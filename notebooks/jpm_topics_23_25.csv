presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter – implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted-average economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter- on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services and Auto – revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter, as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on- quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in capex spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets; and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run-rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.",2023,Q1,False,thanks and good morning

In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",2023,Q1,False,so jamie i was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with svb impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks in your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks but what are some of the changes that youre scenario planning for – whether its higher capital increase in fdic assessment fees and along those same lines how youre thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment,6,get / jamie / obviously / thats / tariffs / different / theyre
qa,1.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.",2023,Q1,False,well i think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there look were hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place obviously when something happens like this you should adjust think about it so i think down the road there may be some limitations on heldtomaturity maybe more tlac for certain typesize banks and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure and stuff like that but it doesnt have to be a revamp of the whole system just recalibrating things the right way and i think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be the outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks and certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker so thats all it is we do expect higher capital from basel iv effectively and obviously theres going to be an fdic assessment – thatll be what it is,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower?

qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",2023,Q1,False,yeah sure so let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook so the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which as you mentioned is driven by a couple factors so the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook all else equal does take some pressure off the reprice and as you said were getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings the shortterm cd in particular is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches its been very attractive to yieldseeking customers so thats kind of working well and then on the asset side we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve which is helping and ill just remind you that at a conference in february i suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way but as jamies pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there we highlight them on the page and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the mediumterm we remain very focused on those,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield
qa,3.0,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.",2023,Q1,False,yeah and as a followup on the point about rate expectations coming now in and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy do you think its more just because inflations coming down do you think its because the feds just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there just kind of your general thinking about the other readthroughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy,21,rates / economy / rate / higher / duration / nonbanks / risk
qa,3.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down.

So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit utilization are all in line with our expectations. Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into managed products. In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year- on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of $1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. The current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic) [$366] million. Expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned upfront. To finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The Firmwide NII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit, we expect the Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the markets and the broader economy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.",2025,Q1,False,thank you and good morning everyone starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion with an rotce

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.",2025,Q1,False,sure ken so i mean at a high level i would say that obviously some of the salient news flow is quite recent so weve done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side i think on the consumer side the thing to check is the spending data and to be honest the main thing that we see there what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs so ironically thats actually somewhat supportive all else equal but i think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions in terms of our corporate clients obviously theyve been reacting to the changes in tariff policy and at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the investment banking pipeline outlook towards more shortterm work optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how theyre going to respond to the current environment so as a result i think we would characterize what were hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a waitandsee attitude i do think you see obvious differences across sectors some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve and also across the size of the clients i think smaller clients small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged i think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage so thats a little bit our read of the situation right now but certainly a bit of a waitandsee attitude its hard to make longterm decisions right now and so well see how that plays out,6,get / jamie / obviously / thats / tariffs / different / theyre

I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex.

qa,2.0,4.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. Operator: Thank you.

But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn.

qa,3.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective.

qa,3.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that.

And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients.

I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment.

But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments.

And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do.

qa,22.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.",2025,Q1,False,yeah so youve slightly answered your own question there saul but it is nonetheless a good question so let me unpack it a little bit so the way i think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment so we talk about those as volume and revenuerelated expenses so you will see those come down as a function of the environment its also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases which depending on how the environment changes could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally ie through the lens of their ability to generate longterm shareholder value through a long investment cycle and so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling we would obviously adjust of course the thing that were not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional longterm investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons as you well know thats just not how we run the company this quarter as it happens a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what youre saying about for example the investment banking outlook but its worth noting that investment banking performance this quarter was actually fine as you know markets performance was very strong and there are also some ups and downs in there i should note including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar or weakness in this case and while some of that is offset in revenue its a little noisy so thats a factor as well its small but im just highlighting that theres some slightly nonobvious things that are nonstrategic obviously,9,ai / environment / cost / tech / investment / expenses / thats

Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter, led by Fixed Income and Equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $49 million, up $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gain. Expenses, $547 million, were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the Foundation contribution from the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now, let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Securities Services as well as balanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%.

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",2025,Q2,False,let me take the second part of that first so we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot and i dont want to bore you by reciting it again but i think its important because it does serve as a guide in this context right so we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth and we ensure a sustainable dividend and with whats left we do buybacks and so weve talked about how excess capitals earnings in store you saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant the cet ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in rwa expansion so were doing what we want to do but clearly it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is and that includes potentially inorganic things now obviously that needs to be done carefully i think acquisitions have a high bar both financially strategically and importantly in some cases culturally and we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well we have learned some lessons we dont want to overlearn those lessons but in the end sometimes we lean in a little more sometimes we lean in a little less but we wouldnt be doing our jobs if we werent thinking about it i dont particularly think other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not that the regulatory environment right now particularly shapes our thinking on that front,12,capital / buybacks / excess / organic / hierarchy / want / way
qa,1.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera.

qa,12.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",2025,Q2,False,yeah sure so i think what youre referring to is a slide where marianne talked about kind of the potential for  consumer deposit growth next year and thats a nice number and as youve written that would produce some nice revenue consequences all else being equal the way i think about that number is to kind of build it up stepbystep so you start with in general the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal gdp a thing thats been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices weve probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows with the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us and youve got some core growth reasserting itself you saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter and thats one of the key drivers and then as you know well when you look at the franchise we kind of have number one ongoing expansion number two seasoning of the old expansion and number three deepening in the core markets so when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth macro environment et cetera thats how you get to that type of  number and obviously things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number among other things youll recall that mariannes slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which perhaps somewhat nonintuitively would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate but the flip side of that is also true which is an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth all else equal in consumer so we like to say those are all else being equal type numbers but all else is never equal,-1,Outliers

So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",2025,Q2,False,to answer your other question mike so some of the – im going to give you some things that you can actually do so i think you should do them and reduce risk in the system im only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second and so gsifi inhibits if you look at it both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making lcr inhibits both because its a very rigid way of looking at a banks balance sheet it doesnt really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that ccar in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘ccarness but theres a lot of ‘ccarness from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility and ccar capital the fsrt the fundamental book when you look at all these things i think you can create more lending more liquidity more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system and also just cet just capital usage et cetera and the reducing the risk in the system i think you also make it friendlier for community banks which we do want to do and so if you look at like total loan to deposits they used to be  theyre now  thats a huge difference that took place over  or  years and can you get that back to  and have the banking system be just safe and sound absolutely,18,slr / system / gsifi / intermediate / markets / ccar / things

And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before we get into the discussions about third quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $4.8 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million, or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion, or 9%, year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now starting on page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time. The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis-calibrated originally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lense on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Capital Buffer. Although there's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have been adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how over calibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the overall capital framework. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III Endgame consistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB, would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends, with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on- quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were up $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion, on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In Advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets – total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed Income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit. This was predominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. And Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year- on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows of higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.",2023,Q3,False,good morning everybody before we

make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the frameworks durability over time the current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification if it goes through as written there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers in addition the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the us capital markets we believe that wellregulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth depth and resilience of the american capital markets which is vital to the us economy so caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude with that lets go to our

So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects.

We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter.

qa,4.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",2023,Q3,False,yeah those are all good questions steve i think its probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front if i start first with the basel iii endgame proposal from our perspective were currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things i highlighted in my prepared remarks but some of them are sort of very technical in nature including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal and so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point i would point out that given how significant operational risk rwa is as part of the proposal that is you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense nonoptimizable so we feel that its important to manage expectations about the level of optimization thats possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed also it depends on your definition of optimization sometimes i use the term costless optimization whereas these technical fixes that dont affect revenue and dont require you to exit businesses i think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past but as we pointed out we may simply need to exit things and that will be because it is better than the alternative which would be to do activity thats shareholder value destructive but it wont be costless a good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight may no longer make sense now thats one that we hope will be changed but its tricky because those are very long duration assets so between now and the rule is finalized it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet so sorry a bit of a long answer but then yeah on quantifying cecl and ccar i think we better wait for that one cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the feds exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth its a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting cecl and ccar is going to be we just know probabilistically that it will like everything else these days tend to push capital higher,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",2023,Q3,False,hey good morning just first question jeremy on credit i think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario so just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today what changed and then in terms of fundamentally on credit like where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side,10,consumer / wholesale / central / credit / spending / seeing / still
qa,5.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space.

Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those.

And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted.

qa,10.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty.

Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic.

qa,11.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",2023,Q3,False,yeah its a good question gerard i think its a little bit bigger picture than that and im not sure – i get your questions a good question but im not sure that the reported interestbearing noninterestbearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons so first like between wholesale and retail weve got some amount of noninterestbearing and wholesale thats part of the ecr product so you see some dynamics there that play out and in consumer in a world where savings is paying a relatively lowrate paid to crosschecking and savings the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now but then of course even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses youve got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances so i would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer thats driven by internal migration from checking savings to cds from ecr to interestbearing and wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment the competitive environment the overall level of systemwide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall.

It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September.

qa,13.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal?

qa,13.0,2.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",2023,Q3,False,in simple terms you talk about earnings power and returns but theyre two different things right we have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here okay so say the numerator doesnt change if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital thats a significantly lower return number i would say that thats probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the basel iii endgame for a couple reasons one is we are hoping for changes two is once the rule is final we will seek to reprice in the places where we can and thatll be different in consumer and wholesale some of it will be product level some of it will be relationship level but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is thats cost getting passed into the real economy and thats part of the point that weve made about lowering availability of products and services and lending there may be some opportunities for costless optimization im personally a little bit more pessimistic about those but weve surprised ourselves on those points in the past so well see and then finally yeah we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things but i wouldnt necessarily assume that thats going to do a lot to preserve returns at the  thats going to be about exiting things that are shareholderdestructive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what i mean so thats that and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and i think its just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on longterm returns from our ability to meet the requirements of course as jamie always says jpmorgan is going to be fine and were building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and well be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve ontime or early compliance which is always what we strive to do but that doesnt really have any particular bearing on the question of what the longterm return target is or the impacts on the real economy,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

qa,14.0,3.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns.

We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest.

Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",2024,Q4,False,so yeah youve noted all the points that we always make so i wont repeat them and i think the way were thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment we believe theres a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest and so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us having said that having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect weve concluded that we do have enough we have enough excess and given that we would like to not have the excess grow from here so when you think about the implications of that given the amount of organic capital generation that were producing it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise it means more capital return through buybacks all else being equal in order to arrest the growth of the excess and that is our current plan although ill give the caveat that as you know is in our disclosure which is we dont want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason but that is our current thinking,12,capital / buybacks / excess / organic / hierarchy / want / way

qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.",2024,Q4,False,sure the truth is – and i guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent so we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses and those continue to be the main areas of focus the execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the commercial  investment bank we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens and thats embedded in the culture of the company so we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that but broadly the themes are very consistent i think in terms of efficiency a couple of things to say which you know well one is when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company its organic its bau its evergreen it happens every day in all the teams everywhere and so that is sort of part of the bottoms up culture and that remains the case we do have a few topdown areas of focus i think if i go for example into technology for starters were putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development and theres been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive and so all else equal that generates a little bit of efficiency we also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization and so thats embedded in there as well and another thing thats worth noting youll recall that at investor day i talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend as jamie always says were always modernizing so the fact that weve gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means were going to be constantly modernizing but at the margin that means that inside the tech teams theres a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on which is also in some sense a form of efficiency,-1,Outliers

And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on.

qa,6.0,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift.

qa,6.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",2024,Q4,False,right erika okay you are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep but lets try and address this not too much great length first of all gsib so yes it was a high print in the third quarter but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter so while our current view of gsib number is an estimate were quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the  bucket just as a result of normal seasonality it was actually a relatively quiet december in terms of the types of yearend things that sometimes create pressures of various types so that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns so not much to see there and the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed gsib rule which is obviously a little bit hung up with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on its not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other but anyway for now were managing to the current rules and normal seasonality took us back under  okay you mentioned the lawsuit i think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the fed that many of the things that weve been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the nonsubstantive bureaucratic burden associated with the ccar process needs improvement so thats great i think i wont speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants but it seems to me if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up so lets just hope that we see some significant progress on that front and then taking a step back at a high level what youre really asking me is what is our core view about and i think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator actually what is our core view about if you just for the sake of argument assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator like actual need for capital organically what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment and the way were increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator up  numerator up  numerator up  numerator i guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerators a little less and then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess and as you point out at  and i think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like  billion through pretty much any reasonable lens its a ton of excess which is why weve concluded that it doesnt need to grow anymore,-1,Outliers

qa,8.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see.

As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one?

qa,10.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you.",2024,Q4,False,sure yeah let me take a crack at that betsy so loan growth i think looking for areas where it might inflect the only thing i can think of frankly that would be in that category certainly in terms of being meaningful to the companys performance would be acquisition finance because thats been relatively muted as a a function of the ma environment and if that picks up you could see more there now those arent loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long so whether that shows up in fees or nii or whatever its a separate issue but as you can see like on our presentation page for the nii outlook you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind and while that is also a driver of growth in  again based on our current guess about the future it will be – its decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite still growing above trend obviously which is great and its a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that were getting from our card clients but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone you know well the state of the mortgage market given rates rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin so yeah i think a higher growth environment a little bit more optimism could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking could you see a bit more growth in ci at the margin yes but i think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are dealdriven i would say so well see well see what happens there and in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green i think you know them right and theyre aligned with our big longstanding investment strategies the biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table so thats why were pushing so hard on that front because i think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely there are a bunch of examples elsewhere but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business inside investment banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better and as i mentioned we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley  co llc thank you,17,loan / growth / bit / muted / little / lending / ci

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter – implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted-average economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter- on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services and Auto – revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter, as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on- quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in capex spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets; and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run-rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.",2023,Q1,False,thanks and good morning

addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so i will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm as you would expect we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows most significantly in the commercial bank business banking and awm regarding the deposit inflows at the firmwide level average deposits were down  quarteronquarter while endofperiod deposits were up  quarteronquarter – implying an intraquarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the march events

otherwise expected our current full year nii outlook – which i will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here we expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as

In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks.

Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is.

qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way.

qa,3.0,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there?

qa,3.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",2023,Q1,False,well first of all i dont quite believe it so the fed has the rate curve the forward shortterm rate curve almost at  higher than what the market has so one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything we dont know what the rate curve is going to be in a year and so were quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that obviously the shortterm read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down so i think inflation will come down a little bit but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore the rate curve will have to go up a little bit,21,rates / economy / rate / higher / duration / nonbanks / risk

And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk.

qa,16.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen.

Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass.

You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve.

You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes.

Firmwide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB Wealth Management business. On page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results excluding First Republic – revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in Card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex. Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12%, driven by higher Firmwide Asset Management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year. Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC's special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $816 (sic) million, predominately driven by Card. On the balance sheet and capital, on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre-pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7%, as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher Card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs which were up $825 million year-on-year, predominately due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card, largely offset by a release in Home Lending. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8K with historical results including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the re-organization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions, with debt up 58% and equity up 51%. In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in Rates and Commodities compared to a strong prior-year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower legal expense. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year- on-year, driven by higher non-interest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year, with increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition as well as higher distribution fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year and client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were flat. Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year, predominately driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish up, we have the outlook on page 9. We now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business, and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income; we're just mentioning this to help with your models. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way.",2024,Q1,False,thank you very much and good morning

qa,1.0,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre- CCAR? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks.",2024,Q1,False,so a couple of questions here just one jamie could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of midcycle it felt like pre ccar and also help us understand how youre thinking about where that payout ratio that dividend payout ratio range should be because over the past several years its been somewhere between  and  and so is this suggesting we could be towards the higherend of that range or even expanding above that and then i also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the cet at  here the minimum is  i know its – we have to wait for basel iii endgame reproposal to come through and all that but should we be expecting that hey were going to hold  cet until we know all these rules thanks,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib
qa,1.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.",2024,Q1,False,yeah so betsy before i answer the question i want to say something on behalf of all of us at jpmorgan and me personally thrilled to have you on this call for those that dont know betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and its a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here but betsy in particular the amount of respect we have not just in your work but in your character over the last  plus years has been exceptional so on behalf of all of us i just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here and so youre asking a pertinent question so were earning a lot of money our capital cup runneth over and thats why weve increased the dividend and if youre asking me what wed like to do is to pay out something like a third a third of normalized earnings of course its hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are but we dont mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes a little bit behind that sometimes if i could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance et cetera i think the far more important question is the  so look at the  im going to oversimplify it that basically will prepare us for the total basel endgame today roughly the specifics dont matter that much,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib
qa,1.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.",2024,Q1,False,remember we can do a lot of things to change that in the shortrun or the longrun but it looks like basel iii endgame may not be the worst case itll be something less than that so obviously when and if that happens it would free up a lot of capital and im going to say in the order of  billion or something like that and yes weve always had the capital hierarchy the same way which is were going to use capital to build our business first i mean pay the dividend – steady dividend build the business and if we think its appropriate to buy back stock were continuing to buy back stock at  billion a quarter sic i personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices i think youve all heard me talk about the world things like that so waiting in preparation for basel hopefully well know something later and then we can be much more specific with you all but in the meantime theres also – its very important to put in mind there are shortterm uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our cet too so you may see us do things in the shortrun that will increase earnings increase capital that are using up that capital jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading we could do things now so its a great position to be in were going to be very very patient i urge all the analysts to keep in mind excess capital is not wasted capital its earnings in store we will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

qa,2.0,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?",2024,Q1,False,hey good morning jeremy can you speak to the trends youre seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter if theres been any change have you seen that migration start to slow or not,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing
qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.",2024,Q1,False,yeah good question jim i think the simplest and best answer to that is not really so as weve been saying for a while migration from checking and savings to cds is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise that continues we continue to capture that moneyinmotion at a very high rate were very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that were seeing im aware that theres a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting weve looked at that data we see some evidence that maybe its slowing a little bit were quite cautious on that we really sort of dont think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above  that youre not going to see ongoing migration and frankly we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yieldseeking behavior so its quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues so i would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing
qa,3.0,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.",2024,Q1,False,okay and just a followup on that and just sort of bigger picture on nii is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook is it migration is it the forward curve is it balances it sounds like its migration but just id be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield
qa,3.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah.

There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot.

qa,6.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome.

And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen?

qa,8.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind.",2024,Q1,False,right so interesting framing of the question erika so i think weve been pretty consistent about where were overearning right so obviously one major area is that were overearning in deposit margin especially in consumer and thats sort of why were expecting sequential declines in nii why weve talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid so i think thats probably the single biggest source of lets call it excess earnings currently you also have heard jamie say that were overearning in credit i mean wholesale chargeoffs have been particularly low but we have builds for that so in the current run rate a bit less clear the extent of what were earning and in card of course while chargeoffs are now close to normalized essentially we did go through an extended period of chargeoffs being very low by historical standards although that was coupled with nii also being low by historical standards so from a bottom line perspective its not entirely clear what the net of that was but broadly its really deposit margin thats the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative embedded in your question i think is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the  cet in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about investor day i was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at investor day in light of potential updates of the basel iii endgame given that the single most important factor for that  is how much denominator expansion do we see through the basel iii endgame at the rate were going we wont actually know that much more about that by investor day so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what ive said in the past which is that whatever it is its going to be very good our returns in absolute terms very good in relative terms we will optimize we will seek to reprice we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability but given the structure of the rule as proposed at least a lot of this cannot be optimized away and so in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes.

qa,12.0,2.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that.

And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don’t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated.

We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A.

qa,15.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason.

qa,16.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.",2024,Q1,False,yeah sure so let me break this question down into a couple of different parts so i think what jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term and what hes kind of saying is that in a moment where youre carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively shortduration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason and what might be thought of as a tactical sense so hes just pointing out that thats an option that you have and the extent to which this quarters increase in markets rwa is a reflection of that maybe a little bit but probably not i agree with you that its hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and rwa to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there but for sure one thing thats true is the higher run rate of the markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses so as you well know we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity balance sheet deployment gsib capacity utilization et cetera in the markets business and we dont just chase revenue we go after returns fully measured and thats part of the dna and we continue to do it and we will so – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints and obviously the environment is complex so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always but big picture we are clearly in a very very strong capital position which is in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the basel iii endgame is final we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up.

qa,18.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case.

qa,19.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",2024,Q1,False,right yeah i mean i think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit private equity community youre talking about different parts of the capital structure but we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas and thats part of the franchise and its all good at some level but narrowly on private credit it is interesting to observe whats going on there so i would say for us the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually its not so much like oh is it private credit or is it syndicated lending its what does it take to be good at this stuff and what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that were very good at in each individual silo so you need underwriting skill structuring skill origination distribution secondary trading risk appetite credit analysis capabilities and this is what we do and were really good at it and increasingly what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit as the private credit space gets bigger it starts to make sense to actually bring in some colenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks i mean even if you have the capital you just may not want the concentration risk and so in a funny way the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space and at the same time the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works so were watching it the competitive dynamics are interesting certainly theres some pressure in some areas but we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none and so were looking forward to the future here,4,private / credit / lending / estate / compete / space / real
qa,20.0,,Charles W. Peabody,analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question.",2024,Q1,False,good morning a couple of questions on the first republic acquisition some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun and im glad to see that jamie dimon validated that in his annual letter when you look at the first quarter it annualizes out to  billion  billion above the  billion that jamie published in the letter i know you dont want to extrapolate that but can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that because this quarter did see expenses come down to  million down from  million and then secondly is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and thats why you dont want to extrapolate the  billion  billion so thats my first question,11,billion / yearonyear / net / driven / million / revenue / higher
qa,20.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie.",2024,Q1,False,okay thanks charlie and im going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much first republic specific guidance but i do think that the kind of framework youre articulating is broadly correct so let me go through the pieces so yes the current quarters results annualized to more than the  billion jamie talked about yes a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of shortdated assets so thats part of the reason that you see that converge yes its also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration obviously as i think as i mentioned to you last quarter from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect theres maybe an embedded question in there too about we had talked about  billion of integration expense and the integration is real the expenses are real and also the time spent on that is quite real its a lot of work for a lot of people its going well but were not done yet and it takes a lot of effort but broadly i think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons one is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly and of course its worked out to your point quite a bit better than that and therefore the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher and that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers its probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative they were based on kind of more typical type of bank ma assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the fdic and so on and so forth so yeah i think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question thanks charlie,11,billion / yearonyear / net / driven / million / revenue / higher
qa,21.0,,Charles W. Peabody,analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks?

qa,21.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit utilization are all in line with our expectations. Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into managed products. In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year- on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of $1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. The current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic) [$366] million. Expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned upfront. To finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The Firmwide NII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit, we expect the Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the markets and the broader economy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment.

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.",2025,Q1,False,sure ken so i mean at a high level i would say that obviously some of the salient news flow is quite recent so weve done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side i think on the consumer side the thing to check is the spending data and to be honest the main thing that we see there what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs so ironically thats actually somewhat supportive all else equal but i think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions in terms of our corporate clients obviously theyve been reacting to the changes in tariff policy and at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the investment banking pipeline outlook towards more shortterm work optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how theyre going to respond to the current environment so as a result i think we would characterize what were hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a waitandsee attitude i do think you see obvious differences across sectors some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve and also across the size of the clients i think smaller clients small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged i think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage so thats a little bit our read of the situation right now but certainly a bit of a waitandsee attitude its hard to make longterm decisions right now and so well see how that plays out,6,get / jamie / obviously / thats / tariffs / different / theyre

qa,3.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is. I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients.

I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data.

qa,9.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form.

qa,21.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down.

qa,22.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.",2025,Q1,False,yeah so youve slightly answered your own question there saul but it is nonetheless a good question so let me unpack it a little bit so the way i think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment so we talk about those as volume and revenuerelated expenses so you will see those come down as a function of the environment its also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases which depending on how the environment changes could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally ie through the lens of their ability to generate longterm shareholder value through a long investment cycle and so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling we would obviously adjust of course the thing that were not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional longterm investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons as you well know thats just not how we run the company this quarter as it happens a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what youre saying about for example the investment banking outlook but its worth noting that investment banking performance this quarter was actually fine as you know markets performance was very strong and there are also some ups and downs in there i should note including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar or weakness in this case and while some of that is offset in revenue its a little noisy so thats a factor as well its small but im just highlighting that theres some slightly nonobvious things that are nonstrategic obviously,9,ai / environment / cost / tech / investment / expenses / thats

Touching on a few highlights: CCB client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM, and we ranked number one in IB fee wallet share. Before giving you more detail on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition. Now turning back to this quarter's results on page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the Firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, $599 million of expense, and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR in the Corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex. Markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items primarily in the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up $1.5 billion or 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in Corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio. And as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4% and it goes into effect in 4Q23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter. On liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our Earnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So when we release this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100- basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have been about negative $1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion, which was up 31% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher-yielding products. Client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto, originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of $8.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, our credit costs were $1.5 billion, reflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on- year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day-plus delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.5 billion was up 11% year-on-year or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In Advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed Income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior-year quarter, particularly in derivatives. Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 million was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing. CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior-year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation, and the impact of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to Corporate on page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last year. NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year-on-year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction. Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both Consumer and Wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out. Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.",2023,Q2,False,thanks

qa,1.0,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond?

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.",2023,Q2,False,yeah sure thanks jim so yeah so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision as i said its higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice hard to untangle the two drivers and specifically i think when you look at consumer the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback were getting from the field and the cd offerings in particular has meant that its quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective and similarly in wholesale were just seeing slower internal migrations you asked about mix i think that obviously were seeing the cd mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion but as you say the most important point is the fact that as i said earlier we dont consider this level of nii generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about a sort of mediumterm run rate in the mids that was before first republic and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher but whatever it is its a lot lower than the current number we dont know when thats going to happen were not going to predict the exact moment thats going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace but we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point,-1,Outliers

Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.",2023,Q2,False,hi good morning jeremy im just laughing to myself because i said to you at investor day – do you have any more nii rabbits to pull out of the hat and i guess you do so i guess i want to ask a broader question really here and maybe jamie id like to get your thoughts so you earned  rotce on  cet and we hear you loud and clear that youre more normalized nii generation is not  billion that being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from basel iii endgame is it possible that your natural rotce is maybe above that  throughthecycle rate when rates arent zero because when you first introduced that rotce target we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybodys talking about even if the fed cuts the natural sort of bottom in fed funds is not going to be zero so any input on that would be great,-1,Outliers
qa,3.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results.

qa,18.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",2023,Q2,False,yeah good question steve so let me say a couple things about this so obviously our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the first republic transaction but now if you look at our kind of endofperiod deposits this quarter and you project forward our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of qt playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share just to give a couple examples like in consumer weve got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there and in wholesale weve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates and so there are potentially some share offsets there but broadly our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise within that you note the same thing weve noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the tga build has come into effect and youve seen a lot of bill issuance big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of rrp and so far with most of the tga build – i guess theyre targeting  billion and theyre at  billion – or something so theyre almost done more of it than some people feared has come out of rrp so as you say i think thats a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when youve got ample supply of shortdated collateral on the front end of the yield curve so that whole rrptga bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant but it is good to see rrp coming down a little bit,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically.

I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products.

So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity.

And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Excluding these items, the Firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up 10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and Card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior-year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also, in the prior-year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line of business. Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex. Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic-related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher Investment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. Excluding the Foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and $189 million in Wholesale. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally, the Firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on- quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In Home Lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior-year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit-related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued strength in Securitized Products. And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record revenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security Services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation, legal expense, and volume-related non-compensation expense. In Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and pay-off activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in Office. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.3 billion, with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year, and client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year. Excluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic-related expense out of Corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on page 8. Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex. Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. So, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income, or more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And, as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline.",2024,Q2,False,thank you and good morning everyone starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on

As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target?

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",2024,Q2,False,right okay thanks steve and actually before answering the question i just want to remind everyone that jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas so its just going to be me today okay good question on the capital and the rotce so let me start with the rotce point first in short my answer to that question would be no its hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on rotce if you think about the way weve been talking about this weve said that before the basel iii endgame proposal we had a  through the cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator and while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing all of which are still sort of in effect most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually like increase the rotce and i dont really think that answer has particularly changed so as of now thats what i would say which is a good pivot to the next point which is yeah weve been reading the same press coverage youve been reading and its fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here but in reality we dont know anything you dont know we dont know how reliable the press coverage is and so in that sense i feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory not much has actually changed relative to what i laid out at investor day the comments that i made then the comments that jamie made then as well as the comments that jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference so maybe ill just briefly summarize for everyones benefit what we think that is which is one we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an everexpanding cet ratio but obviously were going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable cet ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement so after all the uncertainty is sorted out the question of the deployment of the capital one way or another is a matter of when not if on the capital hierarchy its also worth noting thats another thing that remains unchanged so ill review it quickly growing the business organically and inorganically sustainable dividend and in that context its worth noting that the boards announced intention to increase it to  is a  increase prior to last year so thats a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital and then finally buybacks but that hierarchy does not commit us to return  of the capital generation in any given quarter and so as we sit here today when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the firm its kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience so given all that putting it all together and sorry for the long answer we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital and as jamie has said we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib
qa,2.0,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?",2024,Q2,False,no need to apologize jeremy that was a really helpful perspective maybe just for my followup on nii youve been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to nii overearning especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds in the second quarter we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth so just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating do you see the potential for nii normalizing higher and where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield
qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",2024,Q2,False,yeah interesting question steve so lets talk about deposit balances so yeah i see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating when you look at the system as a whole just to go through it qt is still a bit of a headwind loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that and our pe seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system but on balance net across all those various effects we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances so when we think of our balance outlook we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those systemwide headwinds so in terms of normalizing higher i guess it depends on relative to what but i think its definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative clearly the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year which implied a lot more sequential decline is just the change in the fed outlook so two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there but obviously based on the latest inflation data and so on you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve so well see how it goes and in the end were kind of focused on on just running the place recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning whatever it is,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

qa,3.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank.

And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space.

qa,7.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak.

qa,8.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on.

qa,9.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",2024,Q2,False,sure good question matt i mean i guess the way i think about it is a couple of things like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal right so if you kind of build yourself out a fullyear forecast and make reasonable just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter like better look at this on a fullyear basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items and so if you do that like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number thats higher than the  so yeah one source of headwinds is normalization of the nii primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs thats – weve talked about that part of it is also the yield curve effects some cuts will come into the curve at some point and in the normal course if you kind of do a very very very simple mental model of the company you would have like revenues growing at some organic gdp like rate maybe higher and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio but even if the amount of nii normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen so as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there inflation is still nonzero there are still investments that were executing theres still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part the normalization of nii and then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on basel iii endgame and all the other pieces you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator at least based on what we know so far so of course any of those pieces could be wrong but thats kind of how we get to our  and if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my investor day presentation it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield

I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII.

qa,14.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.",2024,Q2,False,yeah thats a very good and fair question betsy so let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability so in no particular order one thing that weve really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings including in our recent qs actually is that we dont want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks so were going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time so i recognize that not everyone loves that but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so i might as well say it explicitly it was pretty clear in the q also but im just going to say that again so thats point one but having said that let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors so generally speaking we think it doesnt make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now lets say obviously when for whatever reason if we ever need to build capital in a hurry weve done it before and were always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely but i think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when youre generating your kind of capital and so we were talking before about this  billion pace were kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace but thats where that idea comes from lets put it that way you talked about the  billion which i recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number but where that actually comes from is the other statement that weve made that we have these significant item gains from visa and if you think about what that means it means that we have post the acceptance of the exchange offer a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock ie visa which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock and so in some sense why carry that instead of just buying back jpmorgan stock so we talked about – jamie talked about as we liquidate the visa deploying those proceeds into jpm and thats what we did this quarter so that is why the  billion is a little higher and its consistent with my comments at investor day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks,12,capital / buybacks / excess / organic / hierarchy / want / way

But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield- seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.

I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic.

And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view.

It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?

qa,19.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient.

Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter, led by Fixed Income and Equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $49 million, up $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gain. Expenses, $547 million, were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the Foundation contribution from the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now, let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Securities Services as well as balanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%.

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",2025,Q2,False,let me take the second part of that first so we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot and i dont want to bore you by reciting it again but i think its important because it does serve as a guide in this context right so we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth and we ensure a sustainable dividend and with whats left we do buybacks and so weve talked about how excess capitals earnings in store you saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant the cet ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in rwa expansion so were doing what we want to do but clearly it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is and that includes potentially inorganic things now obviously that needs to be done carefully i think acquisitions have a high bar both financially strategically and importantly in some cases culturally and we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well we have learned some lessons we dont want to overlearn those lessons but in the end sometimes we lean in a little more sometimes we lean in a little less but we wouldnt be doing our jobs if we werent thinking about it i dont particularly think other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not that the regulatory environment right now particularly shapes our thinking on that front,12,capital / buybacks / excess / organic / hierarchy / want / way
qa,1.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller.

qa,12.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",2025,Q2,False,yeah sure so i think what youre referring to is a slide where marianne talked about kind of the potential for  consumer deposit growth next year and thats a nice number and as youve written that would produce some nice revenue consequences all else being equal the way i think about that number is to kind of build it up stepbystep so you start with in general the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal gdp a thing thats been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices weve probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows with the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us and youve got some core growth reasserting itself you saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter and thats one of the key drivers and then as you know well when you look at the franchise we kind of have number one ongoing expansion number two seasoning of the old expansion and number three deepening in the core markets so when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth macro environment et cetera thats how you get to that type of  number and obviously things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number among other things youll recall that mariannes slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which perhaps somewhat nonintuitively would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate but the flip side of that is also true which is an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth all else equal in consumer so we like to say those are all else being equal type numbers but all else is never equal,-1,Outliers

qa,13.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted I think previously, and as you see coming through the IB fee performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public, and some of that is on our balance sheet and we're very happy to have it there.",2025,Q2,False,yeah thanks mike so on loan growth as you know its useful to sort of break this down between what i would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks et cetera that part of the franchise remains fine but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general but as i noted i think previously and as you see coming through the ib fee performance there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter a lot of which is well known and public and some of that is on our balance sheet and were very happy to have it there,17,loan / growth / bit / muted / little / lending / ci
qa,13.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"To answer your other question, Mike. So, some of the – I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",2025,Q2,False,to answer your other question mike so some of the – im going to give you some things that you can actually do so i think you should do them and reduce risk in the system im only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second and so gsifi inhibits if you look at it both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making lcr inhibits both because its a very rigid way of looking at a banks balance sheet it doesnt really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that ccar in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘ccarness but theres a lot of ‘ccarness from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility and ccar capital the fsrt the fundamental book when you look at all these things i think you can create more lending more liquidity more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system and also just cet just capital usage et cetera and the reducing the risk in the system i think you also make it friendlier for community banks which we do want to do and so if you look at like total loan to deposits they used to be  theyre now  thats a huge difference that took place over  or  years and can you get that back to  and have the banking system be just safe and sound absolutely,18,slr / system / gsifi / intermediate / markets / ccar / things

qa,21.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help.

qa,31.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So, it's pretty broad based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So, I guess, on the one hand you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially. So, I mean, we've gotten, over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues.",2025,Q2,False,yeah i mean one thing ill say is that theres no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results so its pretty broad based and its not particularly lumpy and as i said i think it is true and i think weve shared some of this in different ways including in my slide at investor day that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like gsib capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue and were happy with the returns but its not just like growing without any inputs essentially so i guess on the one hand you might say that thats a bit more durable for that reason but it is important to realize that its coming with that use of resources essentially so i mean weve gotten over time a little bit more relaxed about talking about the markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues,20,revenues / markets / resources / bit / business / gone / little

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before we get into the discussions about third quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $4.8 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million, or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion, or 9%, year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now starting on page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time. The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis-calibrated originally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lense on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Capital Buffer. Although there's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have been adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how over calibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the overall capital framework. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III Endgame consistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB, would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends, with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on- quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were up $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion, on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In Advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets – total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed Income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit. This was predominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. And Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year- on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows of higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.",2023,Q3,False,good morning everybody before we

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects.

We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter.

qa,4.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",2023,Q3,False,yeah those are all good questions steve i think its probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front if i start first with the basel iii endgame proposal from our perspective were currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things i highlighted in my prepared remarks but some of them are sort of very technical in nature including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal and so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point i would point out that given how significant operational risk rwa is as part of the proposal that is you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense nonoptimizable so we feel that its important to manage expectations about the level of optimization thats possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed also it depends on your definition of optimization sometimes i use the term costless optimization whereas these technical fixes that dont affect revenue and dont require you to exit businesses i think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past but as we pointed out we may simply need to exit things and that will be because it is better than the alternative which would be to do activity thats shareholder value destructive but it wont be costless a good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight may no longer make sense now thats one that we hope will be changed but its tricky because those are very long duration assets so between now and the rule is finalized it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet so sorry a bit of a long answer but then yeah on quantifying cecl and ccar i think we better wait for that one cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the feds exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth its a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting cecl and ccar is going to be we just know probabilistically that it will like everything else these days tend to push capital higher,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",2023,Q3,False,hey good morning just first question jeremy on credit i think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario so just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today what changed and then in terms of fundamentally on credit like where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side,10,consumer / wholesale / central / credit / spending / seeing / still
qa,5.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",2023,Q3,False,yeah so on the central scenario you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team no but in all seriousness i think our us economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with i think two quarters of negative half a percent of gdp growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth i think around  for a few quarters into  so just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that were still skewed to the downside were still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weightedaverage basis than is in the central case outlook so that number weve sometimes given you is  this quarter so its really not much more complicated than that were just kind of following the process and i think your other question was where am i seeing softness in credit and i think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly were certainly nowhere thats not expected meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected and then of course we are seeing a trickle of chargeoffs coming through the office space you see that in the chargeoff number of the commercial bank but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that weve already built there,10,consumer / wholesale / central / credit / spending / seeing / still

So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those.

Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing?

qa,11.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",2023,Q3,False,yeah its a good question gerard i think its a little bit bigger picture than that and im not sure – i get your questions a good question but im not sure that the reported interestbearing noninterestbearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons so first like between wholesale and retail weve got some amount of noninterestbearing and wholesale thats part of the ecr product so you see some dynamics there that play out and in consumer in a world where savings is paying a relatively lowrate paid to crosschecking and savings the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now but then of course even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses youve got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances so i would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer thats driven by internal migration from checking savings to cds from ecr to interestbearing and wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment the competitive environment the overall level of systemwide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.",2023,Q3,False,so call it  billion run rate on an exit rate basis and were saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to  billion so thats one building block underneath that i think one thing thats interesting actually is that as the percentage of the deposits which are cds increases the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume its a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration balances product level reprice as you get out of that lower zero bound with  cd mix world things get a little bit smoother i would say overall so itll be interesting to watch that but its obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it but its also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as weve often said were very focused on primary bank relationships and we didnt lose any of those in the last cycle and were not planning to lose any in this cycle and thats what sort of a longterm focus means for us,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September.

qa,13.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal? So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns.",2023,Q3,False,yeah okay thats a good question erika i think theres a couple pieces in there so let me take the most important piece first which is the  through the cycle target are we keeping that or not in light of the basel iii endgame proposal so short answer is were not going to change that number today but when you look at what weve disclosed about a  increase in capital you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib
qa,13.0,2.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",2023,Q3,False,in simple terms you talk about earnings power and returns but theyre two different things right we have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here okay so say the numerator doesnt change if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital thats a significantly lower return number i would say that thats probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the basel iii endgame for a couple reasons one is we are hoping for changes two is once the rule is final we will seek to reprice in the places where we can and thatll be different in consumer and wholesale some of it will be product level some of it will be relationship level but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is thats cost getting passed into the real economy and thats part of the point that weve made about lowering availability of products and services and lending there may be some opportunities for costless optimization im personally a little bit more pessimistic about those but weve surprised ourselves on those points in the past so well see and then finally yeah we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things but i wouldnt necessarily assume that thats going to do a lot to preserve returns at the  thats going to be about exiting things that are shareholderdestructive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what i mean so thats that and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and i think its just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on longterm returns from our ability to meet the requirements of course as jamie always says jpmorgan is going to be fine and were building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and well be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve ontime or early compliance which is always what we strive to do but that doesnt really have any particular bearing on the question of what the longterm return target is or the impacts on the real economy,7,capital / basel / endgame / billion / iii / net / gsib

qa,14.0,3.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns.

qa,19.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size.

This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish. We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation.

And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle.

Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 on revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in Card and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex. Markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year’s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale. Net charge-offs were up $590 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, flat versus the prior quarter, as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We had $6.0 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares, as we have previously mentioned. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.0 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We're seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher NII, partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge-offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year-on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates. Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year-on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients’ access to receptive capital markets. In multi-family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets, and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior-year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion were up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, [year-on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year-on-year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of Markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle.",2024,Q3,False,thank you and good morning everyone starting on page  the firm reported net income of  billion eps of  on revenue of  billion with an rotce of

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",2024,Q3,False,yeah sure jim ill try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability so as we sit here today the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is in fact – that were expecting – is in fact the yield curve so that yield curve has changed a little bit since daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter but not that significantly in terms of deposit balances which is obviously another important factor here in light of the fed starting the cutting cycle it feels to us like right now as i mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer were pretty much in the trough right now as we speak when you look at yieldseeking behavior that has come down quite a bit so thats no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal and then if you look at checking account balances those have been pretty stable for some time which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers so thats kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances and in that context the other relevant point is the cd mix where with the rate cuts coming we expect cd balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the cd mix actually peaking around now and then as we move to wholesale weve actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that its likely that the end of qt will be announced sometime soon thats also a little bit supportive for deposit balances so maybe ill – well i guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year so i guess one thing to say right is that we did have a sequential increase in nii this quarter and as you may recall at investor day i said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that wed hit the trough when that happens so thats essentially exactly what were seeing now but from where we sit now given the yield curve assuming the yield curve materializes obviously we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in nii ex markets but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year at which point the combination of balances card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth obviously were guessing its pretty far out in the future and well give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter but i think that gives you a better framework to work with,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield

qa,2.0,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.",2024,Q3,False,hi good morning so jeremy how are you so i do want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that daniel had made recently just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light i believe at the time it was just below  billion if we adjust for the onetimers this year that would suggest a core expense base thats just below  billion so pretty healthy stepup in expenses i know youve always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year,9,ai / environment / cost / tech / investment / expenses / thats
qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter.

It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.

qa,4.0,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said. Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",2024,Q3,False,my first question and thank you very much for answering all the nii questions so far jeremy is just i guess another followup as you can imagine once daniel said what he said on stage in september everyone is trying to figure out the overunder for net interest income next year so maybe a twopart first question the second being inspired by what jamie just said number one nii is expected to be down  sequentially in fourth quarter i think yearoveryear in  consensus has it down  from your new level so it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve jeremy it could be a little bit worse yearoveryear than the fourth quarter sequential rate but that being said as jamie noted we have no idea what the curve is going to look like right its gyrated so much and so as we think about the curve is it better for jpmorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield
qa,4.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing.

qa,4.0,3.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end. So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",2024,Q3,False,good okay now to your question about the ear so a few things to say in there so as i already mentioned when that comes out itll show a number around  billion a very important thing to say is as you know the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical ear is meaningfully higher than our modeled ear which is what we disclose and the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have in actuality been lower than the modeled deposit betas so as a starting point you have to kind of adjust that ear number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually theres some nuances around how the dollar nondollar sensitivity interact and then theres your question which is a little bit about the frontend versus the backend so what you see is that actually the frontend ear has gotten smaller and most of the ear is now in the backend so its definitely the case that all else being equal a steeper curve is better for us but i think what i would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the frontend so therefore in order to answer your question i would say yes we want a steeper curve but having the fed cut more than whats currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin for the context of next years numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us we remain asset sensitive to fed cuts,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield

So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point.

qa,6.0,1.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.",2024,Q3,False,yeah so let me take time to cover this one because obviously it has become very important people talking about how theyre growing and partnering and things like that and so first and foremost – im going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical i think theyre both important first and foremost we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them therefore when a client comes in we will offer them both direct lending ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending and they all have pluses and minuses direct lending could be done faster maybe simpler covenants unitranche it is more expensive and youre just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending but were going to offer the clients basically whats in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue we mentioned before in the past that we allocated  billion of capital to make direct loans weve actually deployed a lot of capital some of those have already been paid off some of its done so we are going to do it directly and we are going to –  billion could be  billion or  billion not limiting it today i will say today were extending we will do  million we will do  billion we will do more than  billion well do it solehanded or well do it with partners very importantly we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner so we have – i think weve announced a bunch of colenders but that just creates more flexibility and more size were not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody because like i said jpmorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact and were going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that again all in the service of the client and making sure were offering them the best thing and were going with different strategies were not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider i think that would limit what we could offer our clients it probably would be more price competitive we could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the thirdparty capital provider thats our strategy were going to be there were going to do it and were going to do it in spite of the fact theres capital arbitrage taking place so if you look at the arbitrage today where a bank has to hold for things where insurance could they are dramatically different thats a disadvantage but weve had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time we are going to do whats right for the client remember when we do business with a client we also get other revenues off of them so it isnt just the loan we look at the whole relationship so were quite comfortable we can compete i just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that so i hope if any of the press is on they heard this too,4,private / credit / lending / estate / compete / space / real

qa,14.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",2024,Q3,False,yeah ebrahim the way i would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality weve always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment and that applies to – and that competitive environment isnt limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions it extends in the consumer space to fintechs and in the market making space it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that youre referring to now those firms are in many cases also clients and thats the same type of dynamic that you see for example in the private credit space that weve discussed before so theres no question that the ecosystem is changing youve got new competitors youve got changes in market structure new dynamics and as with any business we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that were prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways of course there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that and one of the arguments that weve made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of us capital markets ecosystem which is the end view of the world its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts and a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested and its unclear why you would want that and weve cautioned that if thats the intent of the regulations it should be intentional and wellstudied but in the meantime were going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set,4,private / credit / lending / estate / compete / space / real
qa,14.0,2.0,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides.

And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter.

I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this.

qa,24.0,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years.

But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve?

qa,24.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40",2024,Q3,False,sure yeah thanks for the question saul and i think youve laid out the building blocks there already just for simplicity im going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed ccb deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the ccb deposits and the internal ftp into that and that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things so i think its actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors and i think when you do that what you see is weve been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weightedaverage rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high and that was going to have to correct one way or the other either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings andor we were going to see a ton of internal migration ie growth in the cd mix andor we would see a lower policy rate so as we sit here right now of course we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy we were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin weve leaned in heavily to cds and gotten to the current level of cd mix and thats been a good strategy and from where we sit now we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down it seems that that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective we think the cd mix has probably peaked now on the way down its not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle thats an important thing to realize so all else equal that creates a little bit of margin compression and then through all of that obviously a lower yield environment should mean that theres a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits as i mentioned were seeing a lot less yieldseeking behavior so then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned which is our longterm share growth in ccb deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top  markets in ccb are at that  share number so we believe theres big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of  basis points or ,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. On page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB, to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense and $647 million of net income. Now focusing on the Firmwide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex. Markets was up $139 million or 1%, and Markets revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card and single name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the Commercial Bank. Looking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23 and revenue of $162 billion. And we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year-on-year, driven by strong account growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with average balances down 8% year-on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows – in fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending, revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year, and higher NII. Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14%, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share, while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, advisors and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs, which were up $791 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in Card. Next, the CIB on page 6. The CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year-on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year-on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. In Advisory, fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior-year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Fixed Income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our Securitized Products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue in Rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in Derivatives and Cash. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year- on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year- on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion, was up 2% year-on-year, driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $924 million, was up 32% year-on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by a deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million – with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances, partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives; continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition and the continued investment in Global Shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion – positive across Equities and Fixed Income – and $140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net inflows $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 million year-on-year. NII of $2.5 billion, was up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million, compared with a net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex. Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide, we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology, as well as marketing. Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with Investor Day guidance. So, in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over-earning, as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. But, despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments, and this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients and communities.",2023,Q4,False,thank you and good morning

qa,1.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number.

qa,5.0,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?",2023,Q4,False,hey good morning maybe just to follow up in a different way on the nii question just in deposits can you jeremy discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts and then layering in if we do get six cuts does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits how are you thinking about all that,1,nii / curve / year / bit / little / cuts / yield
qa,5.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",2023,Q4,False,yeah both good questions so lets do reprice first so i think all else equal this more dovish fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice especially productlevel reprice at the same time we do continue to expect internal migration particularly out of checking and savings into cds and in wholesale a little bit of ongoing migration out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing and that trajectory i would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment so as a result if you look at weighted average rate paid for example for the consumer deposit franchise we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher just even in a world with six cuts and thats actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into cds but maybe a little nonintuitive if youre kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid it gets a little bit nonintuitive and then in terms of balances yeah youll note that i said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down which when you consider the qt despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted its a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates so i kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin a little bit more supportive for systemwide deposit balances and then obviously we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses,2,deposit / deposits / migration / rate / qt / bit / pricing

qa,10.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short- term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",2023,Q4,False,yeah mike thanks for the question and yeah – and of course you will as i noted be hearing more from us at investor day and between now and investor day but i will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question because youre right its important to give you the transparency and im going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business so starting with ccb its the biggest dollar driver overall its an  increase yearonyear which is about the same as we had last year one key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that in  we built  new branches and were planning about a similar number this year marketing is also a driver were seeing great opportunities great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing and as you well know our wealth strategy in ccb remains a big focus and priority i think its worth noting here right that as weve talked about and as you know mike some of our investments are designed to produce short term payoffs and some of them are much longerterm and some of them are just table stakes but we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the ccb investment so for example in  we had  million net new checking accounts we had an  growth in active card accounts and over the last three years weve increased deposit market share by  basis points so as weve often said about the company as a whole were very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future in awm continued client advisor hiring is a key driver as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need and a little bit to the prior question in awm we also have a little bit of volume and revenuerelated driver tied to an improved revenue outlook the commercial bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy so we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise and then as you look into  its really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally the cib story is a little bit different the percentage growth there is lower which recognizes i think both our very very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that weve been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains so as a result the biggest driver in the cib is really generic inflation including labor as well as again to the prior question volume and revenuerelated increases tied to the improved nir outlook and i do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that were upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the cib remains fully in effect,11,billion / yearonyear / net / driven / million / revenue / higher

QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system- wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share.

qa,15.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed.

So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients.

Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",2024,Q4,False,so yeah youve noted all the points that we always make so i wont repeat them and i think the way were thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment we believe theres a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest and so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us having said that having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect weve concluded that we do have enough we have enough excess and given that we would like to not have the excess grow from here so when you think about the implications of that given the amount of organic capital generation that were producing it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise it means more capital return through buybacks all else being equal in order to arrest the growth of the excess and that is our current plan although ill give the caveat that as you know is in our disclosure which is we dont want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason but that is our current thinking,12,capital / buybacks / excess / organic / hierarchy / want / way

qa,2.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.",2024,Q4,False,sure the truth is – and i guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent so we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses and those continue to be the main areas of focus the execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the commercial  investment bank we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens and thats embedded in the culture of the company so we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that but broadly the themes are very consistent i think in terms of efficiency a couple of things to say which you know well one is when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company its organic its bau its evergreen it happens every day in all the teams everywhere and so that is sort of part of the bottoms up culture and that remains the case we do have a few topdown areas of focus i think if i go for example into technology for starters were putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development and theres been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive and so all else equal that generates a little bit of efficiency we also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization and so thats embedded in there as well and another thing thats worth noting youll recall that at investor day i talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend as jamie always says were always modernizing so the fact that weve gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means were going to be constantly modernizing but at the margin that means that inside the tech teams theres a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on which is also in some sense a form of efficiency,-1,Outliers
qa,2.0,2.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely.

qa,6.0,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift.

qa,6.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",2024,Q4,False,right erika okay you are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep but lets try and address this not too much great length first of all gsib so yes it was a high print in the third quarter but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter so while our current view of gsib number is an estimate were quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the  bucket just as a result of normal seasonality it was actually a relatively quiet december in terms of the types of yearend things that sometimes create pressures of various types so that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns so not much to see there and the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed gsib rule which is obviously a little bit hung up with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on its not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other but anyway for now were managing to the current rules and normal seasonality took us back under  okay you mentioned the lawsuit i think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the fed that many of the things that weve been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the nonsubstantive bureaucratic burden associated with the ccar process needs improvement so thats great i think i wont speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants but it seems to me if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up so lets just hope that we see some significant progress on that front and then taking a step back at a high level what youre really asking me is what is our core view about and i think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator actually what is our core view about if you just for the sake of argument assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator like actual need for capital organically what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment and the way were increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator up  numerator up  numerator up  numerator i guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerators a little less and then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess and as you point out at  and i think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like  billion through pretty much any reasonable lens its a ton of excess which is why weve concluded that it doesnt need to grow anymore,-1,Outliers

Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one?

qa,10.0,1.0,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you.",2024,Q4,False,sure yeah let me take a crack at that betsy so loan growth i think looking for areas where it might inflect the only thing i can think of frankly that would be in that category certainly in terms of being meaningful to the companys performance would be acquisition finance because thats been relatively muted as a a function of the ma environment and if that picks up you could see more there now those arent loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long so whether that shows up in fees or nii or whatever its a separate issue but as you can see like on our presentation page for the nii outlook you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind and while that is also a driver of growth in  again based on our current guess about the future it will be – its decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite still growing above trend obviously which is great and its a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that were getting from our card clients but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone you know well the state of the mortgage market given rates rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin so yeah i think a higher growth environment a little bit more optimism could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking could you see a bit more growth in ci at the margin yes but i think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are dealdriven i would say so well see well see what happens there and in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green i think you know them right and theyre aligned with our big longstanding investment strategies the biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table so thats why were pushing so hard on that front because i think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely there are a bunch of examples elsewhere but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business inside investment banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better and as i mentioned we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley  co llc thank you,17,loan / growth / bit / muted / little / lending / ci
