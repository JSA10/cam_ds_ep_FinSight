    "- Summarise banker answers using baseline model.\n",
    "- Use Local RAG pipeline to bring in relevant external documents (PRA risk definitions) to create PRA aligned summaries.\n",
    "- Developed a evasion detection prototype that generates evasion scores based on bankers answers (uses baseline model, LLM- natural language inference using RoBERTa and a blended score)\n",
    "- Used jpm_2025 transcripts to get the pipeline working. Validated the evasion pipeline using jpm-23-1q data (involved human labelling the answer as Direct or Evasive- file saved in notebooks/summarisation_evasion_files).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not complete**\n",
    "- Visualisations e.g. how many evasive answers were there? etc - apply evasion pipeline to dataset and generate statistics on evasiveness \n",
    "- Need to test pipleine on larger data set (e.g. jpm 2023-2025) and check against HSBC to make conclusions & comment on generalisability (answering research question: How does one bank’s tone and thematic profile compare to peers? Are divergences systemic or firm specific?)\n",
    "- Summarisation pipeline could be improved using a two-stage pipeline: by first extractive summarisation to capture the context and details and then a second model to reframe the summary to be PRA and evasion aligned.\n",
    "- Post-processing on the output file for the PRA aligned summaries by Mistral model so they are clearer- can this output be fed into another model to extract more insights/ detect evasion or risk?\n",
    "- Increase the size of the validation set for the evasion pipeline prototype (e.g. more human labelling)\n",
    "- Need to fine tune the evasion pipeline to increase accuracy\n",
    "- Optional extensions e.g. using Agents, more complex RAG pipeline (including more useful context for the model), validation of instances of evasion using external news sources)"

On the consumer side, they have observed some frontloading of spending ahead of expected price increases from tariffs, which may distort data and make it difficult to draw larger conclusions. On the corporate side, clients are shifting their focus towards optimizing supply chains and responding to the current environment, rather than prioritizing more strategic work. The speaker notes that smaller clients and smaller corporates may be more challenged than larger ones, which have more experience dealing with these types of changes and more resources to manage them. Overall, the speaker suggests that it is difficult to make long-term decisions at this time due to the uncertainty surrounding the current environment.\n"
