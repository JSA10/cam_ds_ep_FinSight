0,2023,Q4,1.0,1.0,Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_1.0
1,2023,Q4,5.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that? Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_5.0
2,2023,Q4,6.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_6.0
3,2023,Q4,6.0,2.0,"Hey. Good morning.

Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios – is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q4_6.0
4,2023,Q4,8.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?","Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_8.0
5,2023,Q4,9.0,1.0,"Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024? Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","A little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So, the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_9.0
6,2023,Q4,11.0,1.0,"Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I’ve asked you this before and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could AI make a difference? Just a little more meat on the tech bones. All right. Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that – I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_11.0
7,2023,Q4,15.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?","Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_15.0
8,2023,Q4,16.0,1.0,"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?","Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_16.0
9,2023,Q4,17.0,1.0,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q4_17.0
10,2023,Q4,18.0,1.0,"Anything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has? Okay, cool. Thank you for that. Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.","It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_18.0
11,2023,Q4,19.0,1.0,"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_19.0

And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_19.0
13,2024,Q4,3.0,1.0,"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for.

It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know.

All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system.

Your line is open.","Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other.

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning.","Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay.

21,2023,Q1,2.0,1.0,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_2.0

I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.,"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q1_6.0
23,2023,Q1,14.0,1.0,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure.

And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.","Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know.

And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass.

I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.","Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_23.0

What I would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on.

28,2023,Q2,1.0,1.0,"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace.

Thanks. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.","I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_2.0
30,2023,Q2,3.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_3.0

We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now.

I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing.

Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_11.0

Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q2_13.0

We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds.

37,2023,Q2,15.0,2.0,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?","Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_15.0
38,2023,Q2,22.0,1.0,"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside – or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system? Appreciate that, Jeremy. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_22.0

It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_23.0

43,2023,Q2,26.0,2.0,"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that? Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade-off that eventually you'll... Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds.

44,2023,Q2,27.0,1.0,"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?","Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking.

46,2023,Q2,28.0,1.0,"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.","Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_28.0
47,2023,Q3,1.0,1.0,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?","Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_1.0
48,2023,Q3,2.0,1.0,"And just as a follow up, it seems like you’ve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?","Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q3_2.0
49,2023,Q3,4.0,1.0,"Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color in the slides, so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR. Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.","Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_4.0
50,2023,Q3,6.0,1.0,"That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized? Got it. Thank you. BPI did, yeah. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q3_6.0
51,2023,Q3,7.0,1.0,Want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalized next year or later on? Got it.,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out that it’s quite a bit lower than the current run rate.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_7.0
52,2023,Q3,11.0,1.0,"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest- bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?","Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_11.0

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q3_12.0

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.","In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_13.0

I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend.

Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted.

So I think at the conference we said, I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through the budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true.

63,2023,Q3,20.0,1.0,"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?","Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_20.0
64,2023,Q3,21.0,1.0,"Yeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher-than- expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run-off of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?","Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_21.0
65,2024,Q1,5.0,1.0,"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Thank you.","That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_5.0
66,2024,Q1,7.0,1.0,"That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for J.P. and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office CRE? Like, how would you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank you. Helpful. Thank you so much.","Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that’s the",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_7.0

So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession.

68,2024,Q1,8.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?","Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away.

69,2024,Q1,9.0,1.0,"Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...","Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here.

And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets?","Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter.

72,2024,Q1,11.0,1.0,"Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.","Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes.

If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that’s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera.

76,2024,Q1,14.0,1.0,"Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if.","Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients.

77,2024,Q1,16.0,1.0,"Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.","Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_16.0
78,2024,Q1,17.0,1.0,"Got it. And then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category? Either overall or among certain segments? Thank you.","Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_17.0
79,2024,Q1,19.0,1.0,"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?","Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_19.0

You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated.

82,2024,Q2,1.0,1.0,"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?","Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_1.0
83,2024,Q2,2.0,1.0,"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization? Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_2.0
84,2024,Q2,3.0,1.0,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?","Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things.

So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance.

On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust.

And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side.

It's in line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth.

You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration. Super helpful. Thanks so much for that. Jeremy Barnum Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks, Glenn.","Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q2_8.0

Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.","Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII.

But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers.

And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here. All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.","Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_14.0

But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here. All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.","And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They’re just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It’s just that we don’t feel that now is the right time.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q2_14.0
93,2024,Q2,16.0,1.0,"Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the non-interest- bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you’re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield- seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.

95,2024,Q2,18.0,1.0,"Hi, good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?","Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth.

97,2024,Q2,19.0,1.0,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks. Right. Okay. Great.","Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient.

99,2024,Q3,1.0,1.0,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks. All right. Thanks a lot.","Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_1.0
100,2024,Q3,7.0,1.0,"Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?","Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital.

So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR.

103,2024,Q3,10.0,1.0,"And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over- quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you. Got it. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_10.0
104,2024,Q3,15.0,1.0,"Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks. Thank you both. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Oh, hi. Good morning.","Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_15.0

Good morning.","So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again.

The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year.
