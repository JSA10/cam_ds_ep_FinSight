JPM;Q1;analyst;Right. And maybe just to...;neutral;0.9998288154602051;neutral
JPM;Q2;banker;And Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. And not that you shouldn’t do low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff. If you didn't do it, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns that we just grow. We deploy capital by adding bankers or branches or products, not directly by deploying capital. So, just think of branches. That does it or private banking or things like that.;neutral;0.9826279282569885;neutral
JPM;Q3;banker;Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.;positive;0.9977720379829407;positive
JPM;Q4;banker;"Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.";neutral;0.9380638599395752;neutral
JPM;Q1;banker;Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.;positive;0.9007521867752075;positive
JPM;Q3;analyst;Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?;positive;0.9996009469032288;positive
JPM;Q2;analyst;Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you.;neutral;0.9848613739013672;neutral
JPM;Q1;banker;Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.;negative;0.7664353847503662;positive
JPM;Q1;analyst;Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend?

JPM;Q1;analyst;Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?;positive;0.9663454294204712;neutral

JPM;Q1;analyst;Okay. That's helpful color. And then just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the Home Lending, the increase both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios essentially re-season from an accounting point of view?

JPM;Q2;banker;You [Jeremy] can answer the thing about the data, but very important, we love the Middle Market business. It drives a lot of business we’ve built. I think 500 bankers in the Innovation Economy which is kind of new to us think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the Middle Market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leverage lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So, we're going to grow that business regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next six or nine months.;positive;0.952583909034729;positive
JPM;Q2;banker;Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.;positive;0.9994219541549683;positive

HSBC;Q1;banker;Okay.  Thank you.  I’ll take the second in a moment.  I’ll ask Georges to cover the NIM, please, and UK ring -fenced bank.;neutral;0.999846339225769;neutral
HSBC;Q1;banker;On the wealth performance you said most of the non -NII was C MB and GBM.  I think it’s also fair to say that in WPB the wealth busi ness performed well in Q1.  Its revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to Q1 last year.  What Georges is saying is I think we’ve seen a recovery taking place in that wealth revenue.  We’re not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that will continue in Q2, Q3 and Q4, but it’s still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it’s higher than that or lower than that.  We don’t expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3 or Q4, so there should be a level of annualisation on that as well in the WPB non -NII line. With respect to the AGM comment, we said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy.  I think the Q1 results  provide a lot of evidence that that is the fact, that that is the best way.  We guided the market over the last 12 months to a 12%+ RoTE . I did emphasise at the year -end that we should focus on the plus, not the 12, and I think you see in Q1, even excludin g the notable items, we’ve done a RoTE  of 19.3%. I would just draw attention to the fact that in that RoTE  of 19.3% there is a tax credit.  That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter, but even if you adjust for that it’s still a very h ealthy return on tangible equity.  What we’re focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders, and we believe doing what we’ve done is the best way to get improved returns and improved performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action.  We believe Q1 is strong evidence of that.  Georges, do you just want to clarify the tax situation?;positive;0.9996904134750366;positive
HSBC;Q2;banker;I’ll ask Georges to answer the first one – I think he’s probably best – on the mid- teens and the definition on the mid- teens, and then also maybe sustainable revenue, and then I’ll cover the third.;neutral;0.9996540546417236;neutral
HSBC;Q3;banker;On your first question, NII guidance, I can reaffirm  we’re still comfortable with the 2023 consensus.  As you look into 2024, we haven’t given guidance yet, apart from the mid -teens RoTE , but I ’d like to just point out two things just to keep in mind.  The first one is, again, Banking NII would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates , so look at NII in combination with the funding cost s of the trading book and immunise, there fore, your analysis from how much we end up channelling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities. And then,  the second one, just to keep in mind, is the disposal of Canada and France, which will both contribute to an annualised $1.5 bill ion of NII , which will obviously not be there when the sale is complete.  And finally, balance sheet growth at some stage in 2024, where we start resuming the expectation for our balance sheet to grow.  That in the broad sense , is how we should look at for 2 024. Again, we’re not guiding, but we’re giving you some tools that you can do your analysis.;positive;0.691146969795227;positive
HSBC;Q3;banker;You’ll have the details in the AR&A in how we do the impairment testing for the value in use of BoCom, in case you need it.;neutral;0.999886155128479;neutral
HSBC;Q2;banker;So I suppose the way we are looking at mid-teens as – if you look at the first half - we printed a headline rate of 22.4% RoTE. If you take out the two notable items, you get to an 18.5% RoTE. We’re guiding mid-teens to be equivalent, you could say, with the 18 number, not the 22 number, and if you think about 2024, there’ll be a profit on sale of Canada, assuming that transaction completes. There will be a capital policy around that in the form of dividend and in the form of buybacks, but we’re not including that profit on sale within our guidance – we’re not including that in our definition of mid-teens. That’s over and above. So what we’re trying to say we’re giving you a mid-teens RoTE guidance for the core business, not with the big swings in M&A activity achieving it. That’s the way I’d look at it, so we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we mean by mid-teens, and it doesn’t include the big one-offs – either the one-off positives or the one-off negatives. We’re looking at the fundamental business in guiding to that.;neutral;0.9998440742492676;neutral
HSBC;Q2;banker;"And I think I’d reinforce that and add another comment.  The trick for us in the past – we were very good as a retail bank; we were very good as a corporate bank; but, when customers, whether they were retail customers or corpor ate customers, wanted to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasn’t strong enough.  We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capabilit y for Wealth so that that cash –  if it did move, it moved within the bank not outside the bank, and one of the byproduct benefits is, if you’ve got a good Wealth proposition, you also attract the cash.  You keep the cash in the bank as well.  They go hand in hand. And so I think –  look, I think we’re in a very different position today in offering Wealth propositions to clients, and what we’ve done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream so it’s less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking and there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity, and that’s, I think, the exciting trend for the future, and I think that’s why we believe that we’re well positioned to deliver mid- teens ROTE next year: because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering.  So I just want to say that’s not a by -chance strategy.  That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.  Before we close,  I’d like to thank you for your questions and for all the discussions we’ve had over the last five years.  I’ve always enjoyed representing my colleagues when we announce our results, and I’m really pleased that the strong first -half numbers announced today demonstrate the improved financial performance that our strategy and execution has driven.  It’s been over 15 years  since the group has generated returns at the current levels, and our new guidance underlines that we expect to be able to sustain it through this year and in 2025.  I wish Georges, the team and all of you the very best, and enjoy the rest of the day.  Thank  you.";positive;0.9995658993721008;positive
HSBC;Q1;banker;Thanks, Kun peng.  So we’re not going to get into the detail, but the underpinning of the scenarios, whether it’s ECLs or , indeed , on revenue, has the same starting point .  And we are comfortable , based on the work we have done , to reaffirm our guidance on R oTE.  I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue -related scenario .  Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario , with a double -digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the Covid period , just to give you some guardrails. So in terms of Hong Kong CRE, this was a relatively quiet quarter .  We did have one specific name, which , in the performing book, there was a credit downgrade .  Otherwise, there’s really nothing more significant .  We continue to look at our book in detail, and there may be a few names up or down on the credit curve , with very modest impact on RWAs, but no significant impact on ECLs.;negative;0.4837242662906647;negative
HSBC;Q2;analyst;I have three questions. The first is that I would want to ask about what are the outstanding parts of the threshold deduction related to the BoCom, if there is further impairment on BoCom? If there’s further impairment on BoCom, what would the amount be in order for that future impairment to have an impact on your CET1 ratios and share buyback and EPS, and so forth? Number two is related to the $0.6 billion of restructuring-related costs. What portion of it is in the material notable items, i.e. what I mean is what portion of the $0.6 billion has no impact on DPS, and what portion of it may have an impact on DPS? And then, the last question is for Georges - on tokenised deposits. So may I know, for this tokenised deposit, is it only for HSBC clients or also available for HSBC’s clients’ clients? Is that on public chains, i.e. can clients basically use this tokenised deposit to transact crypto assets? So say, for example, if they want to trade Bitcoin or other crypto assets, can they use this tokenised deposit to facilitate that? Thank you.;neutral;0.9997950196266174;neutral
HSBC;Q2;analyst;The first one’s on your banking NII guidance of $42 billion. You also provided some useful guidance on one-month HIBOR sensitivity at 1%. Can you just give some more colour on the assumption that you’ve made within your banking NII guidance in relation to the time it will take HIBOR to return to normalised levels? And then, secondly, on cost of risk, the guidance range is 30 to 40 basis points, and you’ve been at the top end of that range now for a couple of years. Is it a sensible assumption really to think that you’ll remain in the top half of this range for at least FY26? Thank you.;neutral;0.9992514252662659;neutral
HSBC;Q3;analyst;Can I probe you a bit more on the hedging that you’ve got in place?  You’ve talked about increased hedging for the last couple of quarters and you have this quarter, as you’ve discussed previously, taken some losses through the held -for-sale portfolio to improve that now and next year, but we lack an overall understanding of what you’ve got in terms of the hedge, and so my question specifically is: how big is your hedge and what’s the duration of your hedge, so that we can do some modelling to understand how much protection you’ve got into 2 024 and beyond?  Thank you.;positive;0.9995332956314087;positive
HSBC;Q1;banker;V ery good .  Thank you very much, Aman .  I’m going to take your first question about customer behavio ur, and I’ll ask Pam to address both our capital return strategy, as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavio ur, I think nothing that would really surprise you .  Corporate customers , essentially , are in a wait -and-see mode , so some of the capex or large investments are on hold .  Certainly, some of the shipments from China, specifically to the US, have slowed down, but we’ve seen no panic .  So there’s been no significant drawdowns .  Deposit behavio ur has remained normal , so nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and Wealth customers ’ activity, this has been quite strong . Remember, we have a diversified product offering .  So we’ve seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings, be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets, such as mutual funds or structured products .  And when customers want to take a risk-off approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base , so we capture the customer assets  either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong , so we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business .  Remember also, we’re investing in this business, so we’re capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we’re also capturing market share in the way we’re investing in this business .  Pam?;positive;0.9979801774024963;positive
HSBC;Q1;analyst;Good m orning . So two questions, please .  The first, George s, HSBC is a signatory to a letter suggesting to the UK regulators that ringfencing is something that should go .  I think that’s the right view, but we’ve got a lot of investor demand for a sense from you as to the motivation for that .  What is it that you’d say in terms of opex funding costs and Page 7 of 13 what restructuring charges may go with that ?  So when you made that motivation, what was the maths behind it? And then , secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead .  I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost -saving actions that are underway .  Could you talk a little bit about the moving parts, just quarter -to-quarter volatility ?  Is there anything we should be thinking about in the upcoming quarters as far as cost inflation is concerned ?  Thanks very much.;positive;0.9980483055114746;positive
HSBC;Q4;banker;Thanks, Georges. And Ben, coming to your first question, we are very comfortable operating between the 14% to 14.5% range. The comment on looking at it again was removed some time ago, so no change for now in that respect. I want to just unbundle a little bit more on the cost point. So on the cost point, if you look at the guidance that we have, and this is the $1.5 billion of cost savings that are going straight to the bottom line. So the way we’ve looked at it is that it’s about 4%, if you look at inflation, as well as BAU investment. The benefit of that $1.5 billion this year that we are taking straight to the bottom line is $300 million. So if you compare to on a target basis, and you’re starting excluding disposals and hyperinflation, you start from 2024, it’s going to be a 3% year-on-year growth. So that’s what we are looking at. Now, severance and other one-off costs, they will be treated as notable items. Now, the timing of the $1.5 billion, yes, is $300 million this year. There’ll be more to come, clearly, in 2026. We see the full benefit of the $1.5 billion savings coming through for the full-year 2027, and the severance costs, etc, will be more upfront.;positive;0.9993540644645691;positive
HSBC;Q2;banker;I just want to say thank you very much for all of your questions and your time today. We really appreciate you spending some time with us. Just to close with a couple of comments. We’ve had a good first six months. I’m pleased with how the business is performing. We’ve delivered an annualised return on tangible equity of 22.4%, or 18.5% excluding those notable items. We’ve increased dividends and buybacks. I’m also confident about the future. We still have opportunities to drive growth and to diversify revenue while retaining tight cost control. We have upgraded our returns guidance for 2023 and 2024. Richard and the team are available to you if you have any further questions, but in the meantime have a good rest of the day. Thank you very much.;positive;0.9996596574783325;positive
HSBC;Q2;banker;Cost discipline will very much continue, not just into 2026, but further on as well and we also said earlier we will continue to invest in ways of increasing our productivity and that will be something which will be a priority for us. That’s something we can control and we have shown you a good track record in the first few quarters. We continue to focus on that. Coming down to banking NII - you’re right - around $42 billion. You may deem it to be conservative, if you just do the simple arithmetic, in terms of what the run rate takes us to and this quarter we had obviously the headwind from HIBOR, but it was offset to some extent by a weaker US dollar. The timing of how long the US dollar depreciation continues and on HIBOR also is important. We are assuming that there will be a sharp normalisation of HIBOR within this quarter to around the 2% mark. Obviously, any delay, even this delay of the month of July costs $100 million at a 1% HIBOR. What we will have as a benefit still coming in the rest of the year is the structural hedge, which is a tailwind. We’ve got a reinvestment of $55 billion in the second half at 2.8%. We have to reinvest and there’s an improvement of 2% on that in terms of the reinvestment rates as they stand, so that obviously is a tailwind. The balance sheet growth has been a real positive and it’s mainly driven by deposits. Our Hong Kong time deposit migration in a lower interest rate was four points into Q2, but obviously this can move up or down. In terms of levers to offset the HIBOR pressures, the Hong Kong time deposits were repriced. We also saw some balance sheet growth happening, because part of the weakness of the HIBOR was because of the strong Southbound connecting flows into Hong Kong and that immediately gave us the benefit to our deposit line. We have been also active in Markets Treasury. The benefit of that goes into Fee and other income. All in all, there are a number of areas in which we can pull levers to be very confident on our around $42 billion guidance for banking NII but, as always, we will be conservative, realistic, and if we out-perform, we out- perform.;positive;0.9995743632316589;positive
HSBC;Q1;analyst;If we ju st talk about the LCR, it’s relatively low in a European context.  Obviously on a deposit basis, it’s a different structure.  Are you happy running with that level in the medium term, given the uncertainty in the market, and how do you expect the regulation or approach to liquidity to change, given what’s happened in the US?  Thank you.;positive;0.9871998429298401;positive
HSBC;Q3;analyst;"first, the reason we announced a $3 billion buyback  – certainly because we have the capital to support it, but equally , because we have an extended period to do it.  We mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to February results.  That gives us four months.  So I’ll definitely encourage you not to look at $3 billion as the new $2 billion ; it is not. It is a reflection of the fact that we’re aiming for – well, we have a longer period ahead of us, four months instead of three, and we’re aiming to see if we can get up to $3 billion during that period.  It’s the refore a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback. Look, I continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks, as long as  the capital supports it.  We look at our forecast , and our capital build up  does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast, and therefore , it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks.";neutral;0.9994361996650696;neutral
HSBC;Q2;banker;On the Hong Kong NIM, the NII increased by $0.1 billion but the banking NIM increased by $0.4 billion because the non-NII component of the trading funding increased by $0.3 billion. Now, the way the statutory NIM is computed is only looking at the NII component, and therefore it’s showing flat, but as I mentioned, we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards to the Banking NIM. That will give you move visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding of the trading book. Now, in terms of sensitivity to the USD you’re actually also driving towards the same dynamic in the funding of the trading book. Dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our activities with, so when you look at the NII sensitivity dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies, because that’s a funding currency. Essentially dollars is funding our funding of the trading book, and therefore when you look at the funding book sensitivity we’ve put in a few explanations on the slides where we estimated this to be to the tune of $1.3 billion. It is fair to assume most of it is dollars, and therefore reverses it and renormalises our dollar sensitivity overall on the balance sheet to be that of a negative sensitivity for minus 100 basis points.;positive;0.9996345043182373;positive
HSBC;Q3;banker;Thanks, Katherine. Three questions there. If I start on your net interest margin, we give some detail on the net interest margin on page 17 of the slide deck, but effectively the net interest margin has moved from 162 bps to 146 bps. There’s three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as you’ve mentioned. Two, some Argentina volatility, and then the remaining is on – we’ve allocated more funding to the trading book, and as you know that will be a drag on net interest income but also an equal and opposite benefit on non-net-interest income. Our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking NII lens. There you’ll see that our clean run rate ex Argentina and ex the notables has been relatively stable period on period, reflecting the fact that the Q3 rate cuts, given their timing, had a modest impact on Q3. You’d also asked about deposit migration. We’ve again got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question and then particularly the change in other adjustments for CET1 capital, that is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through OCI. We’ve generated a gain on those, which has given us also a capital benefit on that. I think on legacy securities Georges has covered most of the questions on that, but we’re not signalling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions. Thank you, Katherine.;positive;0.9995930790901184;positive
