0,2023,Q4,1.0,1.0,Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
1,2023,Q4,2.0,1.0,"Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?","Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
2,2023,Q4,2.0,2.0,"Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?","Thanks, Matt. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed..",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
3,2023,Q4,3.0,1.0,"Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?","Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside. Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
4,2023,Q4,4.0,1.0,"Okay. And then, just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful. Okay. Thanks. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.","Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
5,2023,Q4,5.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that? Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
6,2023,Q4,6.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
7,2023,Q4,6.0,2.0,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios – is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
8,2023,Q4,7.0,1.0,"And maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filter into multi-family apartments. You all have a pretty large multi-family exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed-through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you. Got it. Thank you. . Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.","Yeah. So, good question on the multi-family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no – no bleed-through. And the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi-family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multi-family portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
9,2023,Q4,8.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?","Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
10,2023,Q4,9.0,1.0,"Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024? Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","A little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So, the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
11,2023,Q4,10.0,1.0,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to AI and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks.","Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short- term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
12,2023,Q4,10.0,2.0,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to AI and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks.","Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
13,2023,Q4,11.0,1.0,"Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I’ve asked you this before and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could AI make a difference? Just a little more meat on the tech bones. All right. Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that – I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

15,2023,Q4,13.0,1.0,"Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts?","Yeah. Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
16,2023,Q4,14.0,1.0,"Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system- wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
17,2023,Q4,14.0,2.0,"Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization?

You may proceed.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
18,2023,Q4,15.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?","Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
19,2023,Q4,16.0,1.0,"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?","Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
20,2023,Q4,17.0,1.0,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
21,2023,Q4,18.0,1.0,"Anything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has? Okay, cool. Thank you for that. Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.","It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
22,2023,Q4,19.0,1.0,"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
23,2023,Q4,19.0,2.0,"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.","comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well or up?","Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then this is like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.

28,2024,Q4,2.0,1.0,"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about?

And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.","Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.

And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most.

And if that takes time, so be it. everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most.

There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that.

38,2024,Q4,6.0,1.0,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer? Yes. Hi, good morning.

You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore. Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB.

46,2024,Q4,10.0,1.0,"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question.

Thanks.","Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there.

47,2024,Q4,10.0,2.0,"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute.

48,2024,Q4,11.0,1.0,"Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed?

Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?

I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.
