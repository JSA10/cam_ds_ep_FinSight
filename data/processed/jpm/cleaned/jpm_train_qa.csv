0,1.0,"Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks. Great. Thanks so much. Relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital. I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro, regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing? Thank you. Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities? So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre- CCAR? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks. Excellent. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you so much, and appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20th. Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks. So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward? Great. Thanks so much. Relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital. I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro, regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing? Thank you. Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks. All right. Thanks a lot. Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?","Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out. Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front. Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit; private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happening? Is that a good thing for America? And so, I just – it is time that they take a step back. I hear sometimes from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved. And maybe sort of gone a bit long here, but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there. I will note that Vice Chair Bowman, gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is, it seems to me, the exact opposite of what we want. So, that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say. Welcome back, John. Read your piece the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc Thanks. So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking. Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much. Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course. And yeah, Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well, and just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks. The trajectory is $2 billion... Oh. Sorry. $2 billion a quarter. Yeah. ...a quarter. Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy. Excellent. Us too. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed. Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy.

So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve.

I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out. Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else. Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front. Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit; private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happening? Is that a good thing for America? And so, I just – it is time that they take a step back. I hear sometimes from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved. And maybe sort of gone a bit long here, but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there. I will note that Vice Chair Bowman, gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation.

And that is, it seems to me, the exact opposite of what we want. So, that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say. Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Welcome back, John. Read your piece the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc Thanks. So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment.

1,2.0,"Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks. I appreciate all the color. If could ask kind of a follow-up, the inorganic comments. I'm interested in capital allocation between your businesses, where you think – if that were to present an opportunity, which businesses would most likely be the use of that capital? Thanks. Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not? Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks. No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization? Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color. If could ask kind of a follow-up, the inorganic comments. I'm interested in capital allocation between your businesses, where you think – if that were to present an opportunity, which businesses would most likely be the use of that capital? Thanks. Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year. Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.","Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets. In the curve basically. This is guaranteed not to happen. So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. I mean, we've talked about that a little bit over time. Obviously, we're not fundamentally capital constrained right now. So, I mean, in addition to the fact that capital isn't the only financial resource that we need to allocate, I would say, the larger point is that any good franchise business that it makes sense from a risk perspective and clears the cost of equity is going to get done, within reason, subject to obvious caveats. So... Inorganic, it's a good discipline to always be looking. I wouldn’t have high expectations that will be how we use a lot of capital. And I think it's a very big plus that we can grow organically in every business we're in without having to stretch. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency. Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Very helpful. Thank you. Efficiently said. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there. Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets. In the curve basically. This is guaranteed not to happen. So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is. I mean, we've talked about that a little bit over time. Obviously, we're not fundamentally capital constrained right now. So, I mean, in addition to the fact that capital isn't the only financial resource that we need to allocate, I would say, the larger point is that any good franchise business that it makes sense from a risk perspective and clears the cost of equity is going to get done, within reason, subject to obvious caveats. So... Inorganic, it's a good discipline to always be looking. I wouldn’t have high expectations that will be how we use a lot of capital. And I think it's a very big plus that we can grow organically in every business we're in without having to stretch. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII. And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you actually go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that takes bankers and certain technology, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time. Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company.

2,3.0,"Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength? So, two questions. First on the RWA utilization via organic, as you described. I wanted to understand in wholesale lending where you highlighted, the CIB was a driver of much of this. Could you speak to the drivers of those drivers? In other words, is it private credit? Is it M&A financing? Is it inventory? What are you seeing in the market here that you're delivering on that's raising that lending profile? Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around? Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside. Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength? Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like? So, two questions. First on the RWA utilization via organic, as you described. I wanted to understand in wholesale lending where you highlighted, the CIB was a driver of much of this. Could you speak to the drivers of those drivers? In other words, is it private credit? Is it M&A financing? Is it inventory? What are you seeing in the market here that you're delivering on that's raising that lending profile? Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts? Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions. Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years?

Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around? Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.","I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment. Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is. I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock. It's all of the above, Betsy, because we are the Switzerland of financing. We do everything, and we saw a lot of activity come in late in the quarter. I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question again? Mike Mayo Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Who's your successor? Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure. Mike Mayo Basic case, yeah. Mike Mayo Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC All right. Thank you. Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long- term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing. I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective.

What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too.

When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock. Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that. It's all of the above, Betsy, because we are the Switzerland of financing. We do everything, and we saw a lot of activity come in late in the quarter. Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one. Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers... ... people have mortgages at 6%, so, right. Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are. And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months. Thanks, Steve. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed. I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question again? Mike Mayo Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Who's your successor? Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure. Mike Mayo Basic case, yeah. Mike Mayo Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC All right. Thank you."
3,4.0,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here? Okay. Oh, great. All right. Thank you. And then, Jamie, there's been a lot of discussion around stablecoin, how stablecoin is going to be impacting banks? And I believe you have an opinion on this. Would love to hear if you could highlight how JPM is thinking about utilizing, leveraging, competing with stablecoin, and how the JPMD deposit token feeds into all of this as well? Thank you. Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks. Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth – for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs? Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here? Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital? Okay. Oh, great. All right. Thank you. And then, Jamie, there's been a lot of discussion around stablecoin, how stablecoin is going to be impacting banks? And I believe you have an opinion on this. Would love to hear if you could highlight how JPM is thinking about utilizing, leveraging, competing with stablecoin, and how the JPMD deposit token feeds into all of this as well? Thank you. My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said. Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve? Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.","Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build. We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does. So, deposit token is effectively the same thing. You're moving money by token, you can pay interest. It's J.P. Morgan Deposit. And stablecoin – we're going to be involved in both J.P. Morgan Deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it. We don't know exactly – I think they're real, but I don't know why you'd want a stablecoin as opposed to just payment. But I do think you have fintech. These guys are very smart. They're trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts and get into payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved. So, we're going to be in it and learning a lot, and a player. Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it. Can I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world. Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build. We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that. And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess. So, deposit token is effectively the same thing. You're moving money by token, you can pay interest. It's J.P. Morgan Deposit. And stablecoin – we're going to be involved in both J.P. Morgan Deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it. We don't know exactly – I think they're real, but I don't know why you'd want a stablecoin as opposed to just payment. But I do think you have fintech. These guys are very smart. They're trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts and get into payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved. So, we're going to be in it and learning a lot, and a player. Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment. Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end. So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts. Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that.

4,5.0,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year, or just too early to call? Okay. Super. And then, separately on the topic of open banking, I think that's on hold right now with the CFPB, on hold right now. But just wanted to understand, does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here? Excellent. Okay. Thank you so much for that. Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open. Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Got it. Thank you. Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year, or just too early to call? Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks. Okay. Super. And then, separately on the topic of open banking, I think that's on hold right now with the CFPB, on hold right now. But just wanted to understand, does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here? Excellent. Okay. Thank you so much for that. And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital? Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.","We should have not given you that forecast. We don't know what the number is going to be. That's a... I would say that's a short-term number, and based on what's happening today, there's a wide range of potential outcomes. But, mechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way Card charge-off works that means that it's pretty baked pretty far ahead of time. The next couple of quarters. Yeah. So, sort of echoing Jamie's point, it just doesn't necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year. Even if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn't flow through the charge-offs until later. So, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they – do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn’t be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so, we're kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the systems protection. So, we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it. The last thing is a liability shift. I mean, I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it, and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that. And if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility on their part so we can all do a better job for the customer. That's why. Thanks, Betsy. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Steven Alexopoulos from TD Cowen. You may proceed. Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular. Jim Mitchell Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks. That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed. We should have not given you that forecast. We don't know what the number is going to be. That's a... I would say that's a short-term number, and based on what's happening today, there's a wide range of potential outcomes. But, mechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way Card charge-off works that means that it's pretty baked pretty far ahead of time. The next couple of quarters. Yeah. So, sort of echoing Jamie's point, it just doesn't necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year. Even if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn't flow through the charge-offs until later. Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out. So, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they – do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn’t be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so, we're kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the systems protection. So, we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it. The last thing is a liability shift. I mean, I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it, and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that. And if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility on their part so we can all do a better job for the customer. That's why. Thanks, Betsy. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Steven Alexopoulos from TD Cowen. You may proceed. Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever. One last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular. Jim Mitchell Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks."
5,6.0,"Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it? Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start, Jeremy, going back to your comments on inorganic things being on the table in terms of use of excess capital. So when I look at the company, so you're the largest U.S. bank by assets, you're also the largest in terms of the data you see every day. And you may or may not have seen that Apple's looking at possibly, there’s chatter, getting into the AI game more by looking at a company such as a Perplexity. Just thinking out loud here, would it make sense for JPMorgan to consider acquiring an LLM, right? The last two quarters of buybacks are about the last valuation round for Perplexity, right. I'm thinking of you guys, you could become the LLM for the financial services industry. What are your thoughts on this? Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer? Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers. Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it? Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks. Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start, Jeremy, going back to your comments on inorganic things being on the table in terms of use of excess capital. So when I look at the company, so you're the largest U.S. bank by assets, you're also the largest in terms of the data you see every day. And you may or may not have seen that Apple's looking at possibly, there’s chatter, getting into the AI game more by looking at a company such as a Perplexity.

I'm thinking of you guys, you could become the LLM for the financial services industry. What are your thoughts on this? Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks. All right. Thanks for all that. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB.

So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?","The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then we have – depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment. And that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So, we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are. Thanks John. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. We use LLMs, and we're going to be agnostic about that, too. There's no reason for us to own one. At least we can't figure out why that would make sense. We will use it, and we will obviously be important in using our data to help our customers. Yeah. And on the question of inorganic deployment, I would sort of blend my comments with Jamie's, right? In the end, I'm just asserting that, of course, we need to look at inorganic opportunities; and of course, that's a question that comes up given our current excess capital position. But Jamie said clearly that he doesn't think that's particularly likely for some of the reasons that you emphasized, it's not easy to imagine a deal that would actually make sense. We do a lot of small ones by the way, which you've seen. Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore. I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history. The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then we have – depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment. And that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So, we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are. Thanks John. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still – it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all kind of hangs together in what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story. Thanks, Ken. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. We use LLMs, and we're going to be agnostic about that, too. There's no reason for us to own one. At least we can't figure out why that would make sense. We will use it, and we will obviously be important in using our data to help our customers. Yeah. And on the question of inorganic deployment, I would sort of blend my comments with Jamie's, right?

But Jamie said clearly that he doesn't think that's particularly likely for some of the reasons that you emphasized, it's not easy to imagine a deal that would actually make sense. We do a lot of small ones by the way, which you've seen. Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too. Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter.

But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit.

6,7.0,"Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then going back, Jamie, to your answer to Betsy's question on the tokenized deposit. I get it how that makes sense in terms of the customers that are inside your walled garden, but it doesn't help them much in terms of dealing with customers outside of your garden. What's holding up you guys and the other banks getting together to issue something joint – similar somewhat to what you've done with Zelle, and prevent these stablecoin companies like Circle coming in offering a more convenient solution to your customers? Without an answer. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase? That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for J.P. and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office CRE? Like, how would you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank you. Helpful. Thank you so much. Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year. Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then going back, Jamie, to your answer to Betsy's question on the tokenized deposit. I get it how that makes sense in terms of the customers that are inside your walled garden, but it doesn't help them much in terms of dealing with customers outside of your garden. What's holding up you guys and the other banks getting together to issue something joint – similar somewhat to what you've done with Zelle, and prevent these stablecoin companies like Circle coming in offering a more convenient solution to your customers? Without an answer. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today? And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?","Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would say. That's a great question and we’ll leave it it remaining as a question. Well, Steven, you're raising a very important point about interoperability of stablecoins and deposits and movement of money and what problem you're trying to solve, but you're raising great points. You can assume we're thinking about all that. Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess. So, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake. Operator: Does that conclude your question, Erika? Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that’s the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens. Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would say. Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it. That's a great question and we’ll leave it it remaining as a question. Well, Steven, you're raising a very important point about interoperability of stablecoins and deposits and movement of money and what problem you're trying to solve, but you're raising great points. You can assume we're thinking about all that. Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers. But, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strongly about. We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we would be fine with that too. We just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail, because that's what's going to make all the difference. Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess. So, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake. Operator: Does that conclude your question, Erika? Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open."
7,8.0,"Okay. That's helpful color. And then just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the Home Lending, the increase both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios essentially re-season from an accounting point of view? Or is there something else going on there? Okay. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Good morning. This almost sounds like a fintech and AI call. But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release. Give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the U.S., what's the state of play there when we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing? Should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out 6, 9, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that you all look at? Got it. And I guess just as a follow on... Go ahead, Jeremy. Yeah. Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen? Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today? Okay. That's helpful color. And then just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the Home Lending, the increase both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios essentially re-season from an accounting point of view? Or is there something else going on there? Okay. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration. Super helpful. Thanks so much for that. Jeremy Barnum Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks, Glenn. Good morning. This almost sounds like a fintech and AI call. But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release. Give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the U.S., what's the state of play there when we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing? Should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out 6, 9, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that you all look at? Got it. And I guess just as a follow on... Go ahead, Jeremy. Yeah. Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix. Very good. Appreciate the color and candor, as always. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?","Sorry, the – I actually didn't hear. Which fees? Delinquencies in Home Lending. I didn't – interesting. I haven't looked at that. We'll have to get back to you on that I don't think it's anything... Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised, so. It could be the First Republic accounting, yes You [Jeremy] can answer the thing about the data, but very important, we love the Middle Market business. It drives a lot of business we’ve built. I think 500 bankers in the Innovation Economy which is kind of new to us think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the Middle Market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leverage lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So, we're going to grow that business regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next six or nine months. No, no. Go ahead. Ask your follow-up. Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. And we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. Yeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there. Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind. Sorry, the – I actually didn't hear. Which fees? Delinquencies in Home Lending. I didn't – interesting. I haven't looked at that. We'll have to get back to you on that I don't think it's anything... Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised, so. It could be the First Republic accounting, yes Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. You [Jeremy] can answer the thing about the data, but very important, we love the Middle Market business. It drives a lot of business we’ve built. I think 500 bankers in the Innovation Economy which is kind of new to us think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the Middle Market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leverage lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So, we're going to grow that business regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next six or nine months. No, no. Go ahead. Ask your follow-up. Absolutely, positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine. And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now. Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen.

8,9.0,"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility? And I was just wondering in terms of your sense of just the state of play, the health of the balance sheets of these customers and also if you can expand that into the consumer, any areas of stress from a credit quality perspective that you are beginning to get more concerned today versus three or six months ago? Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would... Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility? Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us? And I was just wondering in terms of your sense of just the state of play, the health of the balance sheets of these customers and also if you can expand that into the consumer, any areas of stress from a credit quality perspective that you are beginning to get more concerned today versus three or six months ago? Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines? Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning.","Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter. And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch. Yeah, right. Okay, because that's what I was going to try to clarify. Just wasn't sure if you were doing consumer, wholesale, or both. So, let's do consumer quickly. I think we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just – the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now, a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands, but that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations. You saw that we kept our net charge-off guidance unchanged. So, all of that looks kind of fine. And to be honest, as we've said before, fundamentally, while there are nuances around the edges, consumer credit is primarily about the labor market. And in a world with 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio, to see a lot of weakness. Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing. Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period. So, it's kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions, but nothing particularly concerning. Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going to be. Which we know are going to be wrong. Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter. And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch. Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors. Yeah, right. Okay, because that's what I was going to try to clarify. Just wasn't sure if you were doing consumer, wholesale, or both. So, let's do consumer quickly. I think we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just – the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now, a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands, but that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations. You saw that we kept our net charge-off guidance unchanged. So, all of that looks kind of fine. And to be honest, as we've said before, fundamentally, while there are nuances around the edges, consumer credit is primarily about the labor market. And in a world with 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio, to see a lot of weakness. Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing. Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period. So, it's kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions, but nothing particularly concerning. I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing. Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense that people are taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, be the ongoing conditions late next year. Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thank you."
9,10.0,"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters. That's great. Thank you both for taking my questions. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. That was helpful, and would you say the same about commercial? Helpful. Thank you. Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks. Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about, we'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with – as it relates to M&A on like go-no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks. Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters. That's great. Thank you both for taking my questions. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you. That was helpful, and would you say the same about commercial? Helpful. Thank you. And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over- quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you. Got it. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question.

Thanks.","Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter. I mean, basically, yes. You see some idiosyncratic things here and there. And on the point of tariffs, I guess, obviously you recall the slide that we did at Investor Day kind of highlighting that different sectors are going to have different experiences as a function of their margins, their sensitivity to input costs, their amount of pricing power, their amount of leverage, and where the rules actually land. But people are obviously getting some time to adjust, and we're watching it very closely. So, we'll see. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Thank you, Betsy. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor. And then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because of it's knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know, I've heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know. Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter. Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But that feels a bit speculative to me at this point. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Got it. Okay. Thank you for the details. Thanks, Matt. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. I mean, basically, yes. You see some idiosyncratic things here and there. And on the point of tariffs, I guess, obviously you recall the slide that we did at Investor Day kind of highlighting that different sectors are going to have different experiences as a function of their margins, their sensitivity to input costs, their amount of pricing power, their amount of leverage, and where the rules actually land. But people are obviously getting some time to adjust, and we're watching it very closely. So, we'll see. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open. So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios. Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there.

10,11.0,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility? Hi, good morning. Jeremy, quick follow-up on the consumer credit, broader comments taken there. But in terms of the NPAs, the non-accruals in consumers seem to have a bit of a jump. Is there something technical there? Maybe just talk to that. Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean. Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks. Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility? Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list? And what would cause you to end the overearning narrative? Hi, good morning. Jeremy, quick follow-up on the consumer credit, broader comments taken there. But in terms of the NPAs, the non-accruals in consumers seem to have a bit of a jump. Is there something technical there? Maybe just talk to that. Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And the August 2 op-ed, Washington Post, Davos you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank mergers should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service and your answer then was “I love what I do.” We get it you love what you do. But under what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong, what's your thinking? Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.","I mean that's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it. And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment, that will be great. Yeah. Thanks for that, John. I'm glad to get a chance to clarify this. There is something technical which has to do with Home Lending customers in the LA area using our forbearance availability as a result of the wildfires. So, that is resulting in an uptick in the non-performing. But when you think about land value and the insurance there, the actual loss expectation is de minimis, I would say. So,... We always do that for customers when they have a real difficult time. Exactly. So, that's what's driving that one. Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add? I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability. Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. I mean that's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it. And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment, that will be great. No. Actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the overearning narrative. Yeah. Thanks for that, John. I'm glad to get a chance to clarify this. There is something technical which has to do with Home Lending customers in the LA area using our forbearance availability as a result of the wildfires. So, that is resulting in an uptick in the non-performing. But when you think about land value and the insurance there, the actual loss expectation is de minimis, I would say. So,... We always do that for customers when they have a real difficult time. Exactly. So, that's what's driving that one. I think it's wrong. I've always been an American patriot. My country is more important to me than my company, and I think this government is very important to get this – and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. I'm not just talking about the American economy, and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help. That's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help the government do a good job. Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add? I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability."
11,12.0,"Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform, they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration? Very good. Thank you. Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits, maybe in the context of Marianne's presentation from Investor Day. Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper-single digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about? Got it. Great. Thank you. And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may imply for deposit growth? Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy Hi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages – I can see you put a lot of effort into that, and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or months. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, consumer or wholesale payments. So, I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing? Thanks. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform, they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration? Very good. Thank you. Your 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that? Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits, maybe in the context of Marianne's presentation from Investor Day. Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper-single digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about? Got it. Great. Thank you. So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it? And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may imply for deposit growth? Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy","Yeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole, and that was true before, and it's true now with this administration as well. Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let's see how that plays out, but we're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively. Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system, and there should be, and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it. Thanks, Gerard. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed. Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal. Thanks a lot, John. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year. Ebrahim H. Poonawala Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Thank you. Right, Mike. So I’m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he’s at a leadership off-site. That’s why he was here remote. So, I think he left the call in my hands, for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that’s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don’t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see. Yeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole, and that was true before, and it's true now with this administration as well. Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let's see how that plays out, but we're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively. Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system, and there should be, and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it. Thanks, Gerard. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed. I mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame. Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP.

You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal. Thanks a lot, John. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. I think the chance of that is almost nil and I probably am not going to do it, but I've always reserved the right. I don't make promise to people. I don't have to. But no, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what I'm doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out. Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Thank you."
12,13.0,"Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago? Hi. Hey, Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography? And Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal? Thanks. ...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits? Just as a follow up to that then, why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the – the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else? Why is Wholesale Payments doing great? Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago? Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks. All right. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Hey, Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography? And Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal? Thanks. Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI. ...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?","First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted I think previously, and as you see coming through the IB fee performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public, and some of that is on our balance sheet and we're very happy to have it there. To answer your other question, Mike. So, some of the – I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely. That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise. Well, I think one of the things about Payments businesses is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the recession. We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, and that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that. First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway. Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie's talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like, to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So, the number has a range around it, obviously. So, it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate. But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again, assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III Endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and client segments. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks, et cetera.

And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely. Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just, I would be a real skeptic about that happening. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open. That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise."
13,14.0,"Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great. Got it. Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. You didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there? Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective? Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if. Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great. Got it. Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here. All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it. You didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there? Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity? Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?","Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So we'll have to wait and see and deal with it. For most – mostly haven't dealt with this stuff before, and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months, and then we'll know. Yes, and I would put securitizations in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that. Yeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he'll – he wants to go. So, go ahead. No. No. Jeremy, go ahead. No, no, no. You go. Seriously. I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people don't want it, doesn't add shareholder value. And I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at life and you have to ""deploy capital"". So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special dividends, they really basically don't work. If anyone has a different opinion, we're always interested. Gerard Cassidy Thanks, Gerard. Operator: Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase Great. Thanks very much. Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase Thanks very much. See you next quarter. Operator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So we'll have to wait and see and deal with it. For most – mostly haven't dealt with this stuff before, and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months, and then we'll know. Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They’re just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It’s just that we don’t feel that now is the right time. Thanks, Betsy. Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Yes, and I would put securitizations in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that. Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set. The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that, and so far we have. Yeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he'll – he wants to go. So, go ahead. No. No. Jeremy, go ahead. No, no, no. You go. Seriously. I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people don't want it, doesn't add shareholder value.

14,15.0,"Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about the trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that trajectory and jumping off point into next year. Right. Right. And maybe just to... And last one, when you say inorganic growth, would you buy a private credit firm? Is that something you'd at least consider? Cool. Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase that, what type of environment would have J.P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through? Awesome. Thank you. Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about the trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that trajectory and jumping off point into next year. Right. Right. And maybe just to... Hi, Jeremy. How are you? And last one, when you say inorganic growth, would you buy a private credit firm? Is that something you'd at least consider? Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks. Got it. Thank you both. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Oh, hi. Good morning.","Yes. It's funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call, how come we're not like suspending guidance or whatever? And my answer was like... ...well, whatever. We give guidance and we do our best, and it's contingent on a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance contingent on that. So in that context... and the yield curve you're using... ...which we know will not happen. Yeah. And the particular nuance, as you'll recall from last quarter, where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook, including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it's both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact, producing a potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth. I think that given everything that's going on on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the back-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run-rate perspective, introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year. We'll just have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters. It will not happen that way, and we have a lot of options in what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rate. I would say, it's not high on my list because we can do it ourselves and then you know buying people and comp plans. And I also think you may have seen peak private credit a little bit. I don't know that, but we already do it. So if it was the right people, the right price, the right – sure, we should look at it. I think, Mike, you should always be open minded when people come to you with something you hadn't thought about before. And you just get smarter by looking at these things. Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term. Yes. It's funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call, how come we're not like suspending guidance or whatever? And my answer was like... ...well, whatever. We give guidance and we do our best, and it's contingent on a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance contingent on that. So in that context... and the yield curve you're using... ...which we know will not happen. Yeah. And the particular nuance, as you'll recall from last quarter, where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook, including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it's both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact, producing a potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth. I think that given everything that's going on on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the back-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run-rate perspective, introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year. We'll just have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters. It will not happen that way, and we have a lot of options in what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rate. I would say, it's not high on my list because we can do it ourselves and then you know buying people and comp plans. And I also think you may have seen peak private credit a little bit. I don't know that, but we already do it. So if it was the right people, the right price, the right – sure, we should look at it. I think, Mike, you should always be open minded when people come to you with something you hadn't thought about before. And you just get smarter by looking at these things. Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of... So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again."
15,16.0,"Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive – as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation? Right. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Actually I can’t leave on that comment. Peak private credit, I can't leave on those three words. What do you mean by peak private credit? Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time. Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive – as corporates and investors go to cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation? Right. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the non-interest- bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you’re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here? Actually I can’t leave on that comment. Peak private credit, I can't leave on those three words. What do you mean by peak private credit? Can you hear me? Hello?","It’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess that. I'll just – I'll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen which is different, it's not the risk off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time. I've mentioned that credit spreads are very low. It's grown dramatically over time. And you have to pay up a lot for it. I'm not saying, it's not going to grow some more, but I would have a slight reluctance depending on who it was. But your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us; natural fit being product and people and culture. Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. It’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess that. I'll just – I'll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen which is different, it's not the risk off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time. Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield- seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So, big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess. I've mentioned that credit spreads are very low. It's grown dramatically over time. And you have to pay up a lot for it. I'm not saying, it's not going to grow some more, but I would have a slight reluctance depending on who it was. But your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us; natural fit being product and people and culture."
16,17.0,"Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen? Excellent. Okay. No, thank you for that. And then... Sorry, Jeremy? All right. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Got it. And then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category? Either overall or among certain segments? Thank you. Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen? Excellent. Okay. No, thank you for that. And then... Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so. Sorry, Jeremy? All right. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Can you hear me okay?","An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months. So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything. But Betsy, this is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy, and please read my Chairman's Letter. The most important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for democracy. That is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean – and the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change that we've never seen in our lives. No, I was literally going to say what Jamie just said. So, we're good. Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective. Hey, Gerard. How are you doing? An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there.

I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change that we've never seen in our lives. Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say. No, I was literally going to say what Jamie just said. So, we're good. Yeah. We can hear you. Can you hear us?"
17,18.0,"Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you. Yes, just in... ...money markets, Fed funds, the front end seemed to suggest... Hey, good morning. Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III Endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked, 17% through-the-cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing? Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well? Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you. Yes, just in... ...money markets, Fed funds, the front end seemed to suggest... Hi, good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card? Hey, good morning. Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III Endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked, 17% through-the-cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing? Oh, yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, Sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue so I kind of care about it. But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the build-up, QT ending, deposit growth, I mean, that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025. Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number for you for NII for 2025 but it is in there. Right? Right.","Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans. Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there. Did you have – yeah, you asked – what did you ask also, front end of the yield curve, liquidity? Was that your question? In a competitive world, it is irrational to think that – and when it applies to all the competitors – that everybody's just going to make a lot more money, you keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say, it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, “Your margin is my opportunity.” That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So, you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system though. Yeah, exactly. And as we always say, Erika, right, like the market is very competitive and the returns are high. And you know this, but I would just refer you to the slide that I delivered at Investor Day about how, in some cases, it makes, all else equal, compared to buying back shares at these prices, doing healthy, well underwritten, compelling franchise business with a 14% return, we're definitely supposed to do that actually. And if we do a lot of that, it will dilute down the weighted-average ROTCE of the company in ways that are nonetheless clearly accretive to shareholders. So,... And Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. And not that you shouldn’t do low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff. If you didn't do it, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns that we just grow. We deploy capital by adding bankers or branches or products, not directly by deploying capital. So, just think of branches. That does it or private banking or things like that. Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot. Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans. Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there. Did you have – yeah, you asked – what did you ask also, front end of the yield curve, liquidity? Was that your question? Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth. Thanks, Erika. Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. In a competitive world, it is irrational to think that – and when it applies to all the competitors – that everybody's just going to make a lot more money, you keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say, it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, “Your margin is my opportunity.” That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera.

And Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. And not that you shouldn’t do low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff. If you didn't do it, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns that we just grow. We deploy capital by adding bankers or branches or products, not directly by deploying capital. So, just think of branches. That does it or private banking or things like that. Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular – – that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point."
18,19.0,"Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a ""Deep recognition of flaws"" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation. But before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars ""Get over it"" to this week say, ""Do something."" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened and do you really think next earnings call we'll be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks. No, and you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the CET1 ratio, I guess, back down by one-fifth. One short... Yeah, for sure. And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement. And the second question I had is, you mentioned and clearly we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it – did activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess, I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients' thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here? Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open. Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business? Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a ""Deep recognition of flaws"" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline?

No, and you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the CET1 ratio, I guess, back down by one-fifth. One short... Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks. Right. Okay. Great. Thanks. Yeah, for sure. And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement. And the second question I had is, you mentioned and clearly we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels.

Markets? Could you just clarify that?","Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade, so – and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it. I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They've said they want to do it. They've said they're having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages, if it's done right. I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages would come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing on that right now. If you do all – you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%, and the reason for that isn't – it's not just capital. It is also LCR, it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have the same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First Republic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen. We're going to... You can read our – I think our NPRs are public and stuff like that. And so they should do that. Just make a better system. Or you have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. If you don't – I'd say, you look at these rules and regulations. See Europe. If that's where we want to go. Let's just go there. Jeremy, you might want to say – I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly whole pipelines can grow and shrink. And so, that lesson we've learned over and over, and it may stay wide open for a year and a half. Something may happen geopolitically, then all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so, I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yeah, you're going have very active buckets. Yeah. And my version of that, Erika, would be to say that you talked about certain of the tail risks getting taken completely off the table, and that's clearly not true, right. All the tail risks are all still there, quite prominently, and in many cases, in the daily news flow. Maybe at the margin the tails are a little bit less fat right now. I think it's also true that in terms of our – what the things that we've said about our Investment Banking pipeline have been consistently quite cautious. And at a certain point, when you have the type of outperformance that you have this quarter, it starts to make your cautiousness seem less credible. So, we wanted to take a hard look at ourselves and say, what do we really think? And it's like, yeah, the sentiment is better. But as Jamie says like, that can change overnight and there are lot of risks out there. I do think that extending the tax bill for businesses to know what their taxes are going to be, is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done. I also think, when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial liberation day – now there's more talk, there's more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed. That reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. There's still risk out there, but I am hopeful some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here. Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security.

If that's where we want to go. Let's just go there. Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to. Thanks, Jim. Operator: We have no further questions. Very good. Thank you, everyone. See you next quarter.

And you've seen how rapidly whole pipelines can grow and shrink. And so, that lesson we've learned over and over, and it may stay wide open for a year and a half. Something may happen geopolitically, then all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so, I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be.

No. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe still a little bit toppy."
19,20.0,"One short follow-up. Just first quarter, you mentioned good credit, good trading, good EPS beat. I'm not sure anyone cares. They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international U.S. company during trade wars. And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done, getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point. All right. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just on – Jeremy, if I look at your 10-Q and 10-K rate sensitivity disclosures, it looks like you guys have done a lot to reduce your asset sensitivity to the short end of the curve. So, can you talk about what you've been doing to change the positioning of the balance sheet, whether extending duration or hedges? And is there more you can do to desensitize the balance sheet before rate cuts begin to kick in as, I guess, the markets expect later this year? Thanks. Fair enough. Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question. One short follow-up. Just first quarter, you mentioned good credit, good trading, good EPS beat. I'm not sure anyone cares. They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international U.S. company during trade wars. And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done, getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point. All right. Thank you.

And is there more you can do to desensitize the balance sheet before rate cuts begin to kick in as, I guess, the markets expect later this year? Thanks. Fair enough. Okay. Then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?","Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us. But I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and we'll just have to deal with that. Now, before he goes on, what the market expects is almost what never happens. All right. So, it's a good question, Jim. But yeah, as Jamie points out, just remember that to the extent that the market is efficient which maybe it's not, but you can't really hedge ahead of cuts that are already priced in, right. So, that’s worth saying out loud. But, I mean, you can decrease volatility, but it's just a question of now or later. But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did in fact add some duration this quarter, with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit, so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes and like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII. As we've talked about a little bit over time, though, I like the way you framed it in terms of like having the capacity. And I think the way to think about it there is that, in general, it's almost impossible to get your asset – for a bank like us, it's almost impossible to get your asset sensitivity – your actual asset sensitivity down to zero, because you wind up constrained by other things. So, we're in the corridor and we're okay with where we are right now. Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us. But I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and we'll just have to deal with that. Now, before he goes on, what the market expects is almost what never happens. All right. So, it's a good question, Jim. But yeah, as Jamie points out, just remember that to the extent that the market is efficient which maybe it's not, but you can't really hedge ahead of cuts that are already priced in, right.

So, we're in the corridor and we're okay with where we are right now. Yeah. So asset acquisitions, I mean I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things. But if you listen to what I'm saying about my caution about the world, it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets."
20,21.0,"Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks. That's a great point. Thanks for that. Appreciate it. Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators look at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheets into lower risk assets. Do you see that, is it really just a supply issue or how do you think about the demand-supply dynamic, and is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower margin areas. Just your thoughts. All right. Thanks for the color. As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question. Alright. Thank you. Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better?

I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower margin areas. Just your thoughts. All right. Thanks for the color. What about loans? The Apple card…","I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully. And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier, we're happy to see that... Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down. But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true. And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss- calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as a policy priority. Thanks, Glenn. Operator: Thank you. And our final question will go to the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. You may proceed. Yeah, it's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point, so I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized, because I think everyone's assuming it will go in roughly in its current form. And I’m like a broken record. It's not SLR, it's LCR, it's G-SIFI, it's CCAR, it's Basel IV, the gold plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, et cetera. And even how you measure liquidity which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery. They should look at all of that if they really want to fix the system. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Ken Usdin from Autonomous. You may proceed. Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that. Thanks. Operator: We have no further questions at this time. Thank you, everyone.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully. And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier, we're happy to see that... Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down. But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true. And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss- calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as a policy priority. Thanks, Glenn. Operator: Thank you. And our final question will go to the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. You may proceed. Yeah, it's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point, so I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized, because I think everyone's assuming it will go in roughly in its current form. And I’m like a broken record. It's not SLR, it's LCR, it's G-SIFI, it's CCAR, it's Basel IV, the gold plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, et cetera. And even how you measure liquidity which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery. They should look at all of that if they really want to fix the system. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Ken Usdin from Autonomous. You may proceed. But creating those assets to help clients. That's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. If our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course be that we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing, can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable. And yeah, if we could find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in your closest category..."
21,22.0,"Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you – does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments? Or do you think that's just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy. Thanks. Good morning. First question is, I just wanted to ask you about the recent Sapphire price changes and just what you're seeing in terms of initial response and just how that fits in strategically with the competitive landscape on card and your growth opportunity.

And what about like a private label credit card, for example.","Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously. Can I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. Okay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we – that hopefully we can get rid of and will reduce the cost of the system and – but it's not the new branches, so. And the folks here are working on, we call it, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that, so – and we're having fun doing it. It's like – to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while, so – and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner. Thank you. We'll talk to you next quarter.

And also, how much is just your ability to kind of use the balance sheet to boost results also, could that make it more sustainable regardless of what the environment is doing? Thanks a lot. Got it.

Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.","Good question. Honestly, I think it's kind of all of the above, basically. No question that the tone shifted. Obviously, it shifted in Investment Banking. I think I personally was a little bit surprised by the resilience of the Markets revenues in the second half of the quarter, because I was sort of expecting a little bit of an offset between the two. I was not surprised. Jeremy Barnum But it's not like I thought it would do badly, but it sort of did quite well in the volatility in the first half of the quarter, and then it got quiet, but despite that we still did nicely. And I think the point actually sort of to your question is that, yes, we are seeing opportunities to deploy capital and other resources; and yeah, maybe at the margin that does contribute a little bit to durability. We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. Obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we should expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway, but we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate, and then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now, of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But a thing I like to remind myself of, to your point is that, while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot. So, we are deploying a lot of capital and other resources in this business, and we're earning good returns on it, but the revenue growth is not coming for free. So, it's us running the place, basically. Thanks a lot. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt, you've got some major static on the line. I don't know if we're going to be able to hear you. Just give it a shot. Give it a shot. Good question.

While I say that, I always tell the management team second-guess me. I mean, we’ve done private label. I know what it is, we've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible it's going to be different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible, so I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie I think clearly the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, we'd say no, there's no chance."
23,24.0,"Can you hear me better now? Can you hear me better now? Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise. Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure. But you're not dramatically above those levels. Yes. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got. Jeremy Barnum Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks, Saul.","Not really, but let's try. Let's try. Not really, but let's try. Let's try. Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in Consumer. Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you're looking at, say, what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money if that happens, it's 2% to 2.5%. Absolutely. Yeah, we agree. Very good returns in business in both Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what would be normal margins over time. And we're very comfortable doing very nice business for you all. Thank you. Operator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

25,26.0,"Hi, thanks. Just two quick follow ups. On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines, I know we've been here before and markets can giveth and taketh away, but there is a time value in there, meaning corporates and more importantly sponsors need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time? We've been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now. Does it feel more doable as long as the market doesn't take the rug out from under us?

There are companies going public, they're in the pipeline, they want to go public, et cetera. Sponsors are still, at least from what I can tell anecdotally, still reluctant to use the public markets. There obviously maybe more of it, but it hasn't been a mountain of stuff coming out. Yeah. I think that's right in the IPO space at least for now. But I have heard some things to support some elements of your narrative Glenn, the effect of that – now, there is pressure to kind of recycle capital and get things done. And yeah, sure, after the initial shock of tariff policy changes, everyone kind of went on hold. But as we've noted in our comments a few times today, at a certain moment you just have to move on with life, and it does feel like some of that is happening just because you can't delay forever.

26,27.0,"I hear you. The follow-up on the capital conversation, obviously impressive to see big returns on even higher capital bases.

Wait, I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn. So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact. So, that's all to the good in some sense. Now the other part of your question, can you just repeat it? I want to make sure I understand it. Okay.

28,29.0,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the one-time effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was – excuse me, guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some one-time – not one-time items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially – I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%? Jeremy, I'm glad you're still using HP 12C, that's good. Just as a follow-up... Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie.

Jeremy, I'm glad you're still using HP 12C, that's good. Just as a follow-up...","Jeremy can answer this, but this will be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we can not just earn 17% ROTCE and that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17%, you’re a bond. You will trade three times tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so, the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your business, which we are doing. If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers and internationally. And when you look at the midcap business we're doing in Europe, it's been great. Innovation Economy has been great. We're gaining shares in lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the International Private Bank, payment systems. We’re investing in all those things to grow our franchises and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that. That is the best way to use it. Yeah. And Gerard, I guess on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable, and I feel like it's kind of all of the above. Let me say what I mean. Like, on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right. Rates are at a good level for us, deal activity is high, capital markets are very strong, consumer credit is excellent, wholesale credit is excellent, wealth management, asset management, essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders, with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse; and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well, and we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about. Some of those investments in various ways are paying off. So... You have – all of our major bank competitors are back and growing and expanding. You have the fintech folks who are quite capable and quite smart who want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion that somehow we're not going deal with our competitors, which protects JPMorganChase, we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day. And so, we're quite cautious to just declare victory like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. Also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, actually I had Jeremy do his number one point, if you compounded 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of United States of America, for 40 years maybe. Yeah. I always have to go put new batteries in my HP 12C when you ask me that question. All right. Yeah. He just uses his big brain, he doesn't need the 12C.

30,31.0,"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. I just want to follow-up on Ken's question about sales and trading.

I mean, how are you thinking about how much of this really is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable and presumably less volatility, good for investment banking. But do you see – would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result? Or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share?

Our final question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Yeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So, it's pretty broad based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So, I guess, on the one hand you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially. So, I mean, we've gotten, over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues. It's obviously extremely client centric, there's a lot of financing of various types that's being supplied, and it seems to, if anything, more often than not be counter-cyclical rather than pro-cyclical. But it's still Markets, right? Things can happen, it's volatile, there's risk taking involved, that's part of the point that we build. Sorry to hedge the answer, but that's kind of how we think about it. Yeah.
