1.0,"Good morning, both, and thank you for taking my questions .  Firstly, you mentioned in the release that you’ve launched a strategic review of Malta .  At full -year results, we were relatively early in the strategic refresh process .  Are there other geographies that you’re also strategically reviewing ?  At full -year results, you talked about $1.5 billion of gross cost saves .  Now you’re deeper into that process, have you seen any potential to be able to achieve cost saves in excess of that  target? And then, secondly, one of the features of your Q1 results was the strength  in fees and other income .  Can you provide some colour on how substantial that print is and how much is driven by the augmented volatility ?  Thank you.","Ben, just to add, for the quarter, there’s been good performance, and there’s been high level of client activity, which has benefited FX, debt, equities, markets, and Wealth . Also, I want to just remind that one benefit was also the Argentina headwind that we had of $0.2 billion in Q1 of ’24, which, obviously, didn’t repeat in this quarter because of the sale .  But the key franchise factors are Wealth – it’s a structural growth, and those dynamics will persist . They are driven by our brand .  They’re driven by the range of products we have to offer, the improvements we’ve made in terms of technology, and that investment is going to pay .  And as Georges said, we stay confident in terms of double -digit growth in the medium term. On Wholesale Transaction Banking, it remains an area of competitive advantage .  We will continue to grow there, but it’s going to be hard to predict quarter to quarter, especially in the current environment .  Volatility has definitely benefited us in this quarter, so it may not repeat at the very high levels that we’ve seen in this quarter, but we are still continuing to see underlying growth as we have progressed through in Q2.",,24.872125536203384,45.01854667623974,42.204432282805996,22.600052689782295,36.60767721627601,37.463638748726105,2025,Q1,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Costs & efficiency

So firstly, broadly , in terms of context setting, every quarter , we do a range of scenario analysis .  This quarter, we looked at the significant but plausible downside scenario resulting from an increase in tariffs .  We ho med in on one scenario after looking at a range of possible outcomes, which, as you know, are uncertain and remain very wide. Page 5 of 13 So the specific scenario which we ho med into was based on a significant increase in tariffs, as well as retaliatory tariffs .  We also took a holistic approach .  We considered different businesses, different geographies, as well as customer segments , and this scenario resulted in a significant decline in trade and a significant slowdown in global GDP growth. We looked at the impact of this both in terms of revenue through lower balances, but also on flow-based income .  In addition, just like we took a reserve of $150 million in this quarter from a downside scenario, we further looked at the downside scenario on a 100% probability basis and came up with a number , which is the $0.5 billion provision best estimate in terms of the tariffs.",,32.13084027171135,44.430201724057696,40.66141925811264,54.54346171751436,46.545027566561565,39.81794117942782,2025,Q1,Evasive,Direct,Evasive,Direct,Credit risk

2.0,"Hi, George s.  Hi, Pam .  This is Kunp eng of China Securities .  Thank you for taking my question .  I have two questions .  The first is also some follow -ups on the plausible downside trade scenario .  If we compare the  – you have two scenario tests  – one for trade, one for ECL  – and we got your set of assumptions for those ECL tests from your annual report .  So if we compare those two tests, are the assumptions for the trade test better or worse than the  – I mean  the downside scen ario – better  or worse than those set of assumptions used in the ECL test ?  And also, is the low single -digit revenue impact just for some one -year revenue or for every year’s revenue thereafter ?  That’s the first question. The second question is, could you please give us some colo ur on the latest trend on Hong Kong CRE ?  Thank you.","Thanks, Kun peng.  So we’re not going to get into the detail, but the underpinning of the scenarios, whether it’s ECLs or , indeed , on revenue, has the same starting point .  And we are comfortable , based on the work we have done , to reaffirm our guidance on R oTE.  I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue -related scenario .  Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario , with a double -digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the Covid period , just to give you some guardrails. So in terms of Hong Kong CRE, this was a relatively quiet quarter .  We did have one specific name, which , in the performing book, there was a credit downgrade .

I’m going to take your first question about customer behavio ur, and I’ll ask Pam to address both our capital return strategy, as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavio ur, I think nothing that would really surprise you .  Corporate customers , essentially , are in a wait -and-see mode , so some of the capex or large investments are on hold .  Certainly, some of the shipments from China, specifically to the US, have slowed down, but we’ve seen no panic .  So there’s been no significant drawdowns .  Deposit behavio ur has remained normal , so nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and Wealth customers ’ activity, this has been quite strong . Remember, we have a diversified product offering .  So we’ve seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings, be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets, such as mutual funds or structured products .  And when customers want to take a risk-off approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base , so we capture the customer assets  either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong , so we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business .  Remember also, we’re investing in this business, so we’re capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we’re also capturing market share in the way we’re investing in this business .

Thank you.","Thanks, Aman .  So just one point to add on the Wealth customer behavio urs. Our strength really lies in our very broad product proposition .  So as we see the mix shift between US equities or Asian equities, or , indeed , into short -term fixed income products, we are there to support our customers, as well as in terms of insurance on more protection and savings -related products .  So that gives us confidence that this double -digit growth continues, and we have seen the same trend even through April, and the same trend also, no panic, no drawdowns, and deposit behavio ur normal through April .  So that’s just to set that. So coming down to distribution , just as a starting point, we have our policy on ordinary dividends .  I’m assuming your question is much more on share buybacks, but let me see overall on the process we follow .  Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of our CET1, and you know our CET1 operating range is between 14 % to 14.5% .  We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do .  And what’s very important is , routinely, we look at a range of scenario s in terms of the macroeconomic environment, and then , based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital .  We have not changed our view on capital redeployment, but , as I’ve said, we look at opportunities, we look at the generative capability, quarter on quarter, and that’s how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks.",,19.650925397872925,48.975441833850084,44.88862495903016,54.37924841914389,49.414438404008045,37.97874817035865,2025,Q1,Direct,Direct,Evasive,Direct,Capital adequacy

4.0,"Good m orning . So two questions, please .  The first, George s, HSBC is a signatory to a letter suggesting to the UK regulators that ringfencing is something that should go .  I think that’s the right view, but we’ve got a lot of investor demand for a sense from you as to the motivation for that .  What is it that you’d say in terms of opex funding costs and Page 7 of 13 what restructuring charges may go with that ?  So when you made that motivation, what was the maths behind it? And then , secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead .  I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost -saving actions that are underway .  Could you talk a little bit about the moving parts, just quarter -to-quarter volatility ?  Is there anything we should be thinking about in the upcoming quarters as far as cost inflation is concerned ?  Thanks very much.","Thanks, Jason .  So firstly, we manage costs to a full -year number .  And quarter on quarter, you can see some volatility .  But just to clarify, our full -year 2025 guidance of plus 3% is on a base of $31.9 billion, which is the full -year ’24 restated to the average FX for Q1 2025 .  So just unbundling that, the 3%, the dependenc y is on  the 4% inflation investment spend and the benefit of $0.3 billion, so the 1% from the P&L saves from the simplification as we guided at Q4, and the actions that are going to reali se that $300 million in the year have been already broadly taken , so the P&L will come through in subsequent months.",,19.614200592041016,45.24284252312486,48.270172093895326,24.20441523385306,39.239143283624415,35.63210179896842,2025,Q1,Direct,Direct,Direct,Direct,Funding & capital markets
5.0,"H i, George s and Pam .  Thanks for taking my questions . Great results, but , clearly , the focus is on the new tariff world , and I want to try to understand, first of all, your targeting guidance around interest rates in particular, but also GDP assumptions .  You mentioned mid -April, but , clearly , a lot happened in April , so I’m just trying to understand what date or what week we should use as guidance in terms of interest rate assumption, if you could give maybe GDP assumptions. And secondly, coming to your sensitivities or your analysis around tariff impact, if you could discuss again interest rate assumptions , in particular in GDP, but also your assumptions about China as a trading counterparty in terms of your revenues versus the corridors you talk about, because , clearly , really , in the new world, the corridors seem to be impacted as well .  So are you assuming corridors can grow , or do you assume corridors would also be negatively impacted in a new tariff world? And lastly, in that context, can you just talk about cost flexibility , as you didn’t discuss that?","T hank you, Kian .  So firstly, just to reiterate, the $42 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full -year 2025 .  Now, we’ve looked at a range of reasonable upside /downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios , despite the stress work that we have done .  Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us on a good trajectory, given that range of scenarios we’ve looked at  – all plausible upsides and downsides. Now, as always, there are four key drivers .  The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves .  The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates .  We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment, so there’ll be an upside to that .  The other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we’ve said before, and loans stay muted .  Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong  Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had contracted. Now, the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year, at 39%, and that is continuing even through April .  So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behavio urs of our customers, both from a corporate side as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable. So on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is – and it’s all in terms of seeing the various scenarios , in terms of delivering the mid -teens RoTE.  Firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking NII, which is Wholesale Transaction Banking, and it has many more products beyond trade finance.  It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra -regional corridors.  When we have looked at the downside scenario, we’ve looked at higher tariffs, we have l ooked at impact on GDP, we have looked more broadly at policy rates, inflation – the big picture – but again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside two scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double -digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the Covid period. So if we look at all that, we come to a low single -digit percentage impact on revenues, and within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid - teens RoTE for the next three years.  Now, the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter -on-quarter. Page 9 of 13 On costs, our cost trajectory is on track, and given this, there’s no shift on that, and we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming ver y quickly in those areas, even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that’s primarily on the wealth side.",,20.23778736591339,51.64208908163881,41.34436500593648,44.74359520009809,45.91001642922446,39.86547593824178,2025,Q1,Direct,Direct,Direct,Direct,Interest rate risk / NII

If I could have a couple on the organisational simplification and then also just one clarification on wealth.  On the organisational simplification, you previously guided to $1.8 billion of restructuring costs, and you said the majority of that is expected to be booked in 2025.  I think you only took $141 million in Q1, so presumably, we should expect a big step -up in the restructuring charges from Q2 onwards for the rest of this year.  And then the second question attac hed to this is you said that the actions you’ve taken to date would already translate into $300 million of annualised savings.  I appreciate in Q1, you’ve had very little of that, but nonetheless, you’re still guiding to $300 million for the full year 2025 when you’ve already achieved $300 million annualised and there’s presumably more to come over the remaining year with the additional restructuring.  So can you just clarify a bit there on why more of the savings are not flowing into full -year 2025 compare d to 2026? And then on wealth, given the new segmental split, is it possible to get the split of the Asian invested assets and the $16 billion Asian net new invested assets this quarter that’s attributable to Hong Kong?

So firstly, in terms of the actions taken and the P&L coming through for the year, the actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated.  There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform.  Typically, in tends to be about a quarter – 90 days.  So when you see an action has been taken, you know a saving is going to come through but there is going to be a time lag between that decision and the savings feeding into the P&L.  So when we said the majority of the actions have already been taken, the annualised savings that we calculated, it’s for the full year.  So it’s not as though these actions are already banked and there’s going to be further, so that’s the main piece. Now, on restructuring costs, you’re absolutely right that there is going to be the majority of the restructuring cost taken in 2025 rather than 2026, and I would expect most of that to come through Q2, Q3 and then some Q4 and tapering down as we go into 20 26.",,30.230165272951126,49.70325457629235,44.63500692075315,24.31772375736496,39.55199508480349,42.40084608753939,2025,Q1,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Costs & efficiency

The first one – I noticed that your cost guidance is based on an average Page 11 of 13 exchange rate in Q1, but the US dollar is off 6% since then, so I assume that if we were to actually do that at today’s exchange rate, your cost number would be somewhat higher than that.  I’m just trying to check – is your revenue guidance also based on t hose exchange rates? Is it effectively like we should gear up both revenue and costs for the weakened dollar in terms of our expectations?  That’s the first point.

Let me take your plausible downside scenario, and I’ll ask Pam to address the cost question as well as the Bocom  accounting question.

We do recognise that there is uncertainty and it’s very difficult to understand how much downside or upside there is in the future outlook for this, but we believe this plausible downside scenario is not the expec ted scenario, as in it is a lower probability downside than the expected scenario.

So absolutely, being a stress downside scenario, plausible but severe, we typically take the downside.  We don’t take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures.  It’s purely tariffs and retaliator y tariffs in a plausible range.  So all said and done, just want to reaffirm it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving. On loan growth, the situation is, in some ways, similar to where were at the end of Q4, because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision -making, so we are not seeing any of those capex decisions being brought forward.  They were delayed.  They will continue to be delayed. Hopefully at some stage, some certainty remains there will be loan growth.  We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns, just lik e we observed in Q2 of 2020.  At this point of time, there is no increa se in drawdowns.  So overall from a loan growth perspective, I will say still muted in terms of what we are seeing.  The only thing I would say is that if there is continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit of pick -up from an OpEx perspe ctive on working capital, because then you have to pay important duties up front and there’s some delays and some of the money’s coming and so on, so that will have an impact.  But from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidanc e of $42 billion is really deposits, for which we have a very strong franchise.  We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expected that to grow.  Of course, there’ll be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter -on-quarter, bu t overall that trend has continued.",,28.68265002965927,44.729351963293794,50.189889094088926,34.92536745547583,43.28153617095285,38.711838738180845,2025,Q1,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Capital adequacy
1.0,"The first one’s on your banking NII guidance of $42 billion. You also provided some useful guidance on one-month HIBOR sensitivity at 1%. Can you just give some more colour on the assumption that you’ve made within your banking NII guidance in relation to the time it will take HIBOR to return to normalised levels? And then, secondly, on cost of risk, the guidance range is 30 to 40 basis points, and you’ve been at the top end of that range now for a couple of years. Is it a sensible assumption really to think that you’ll remain in the top half of this range for at least FY26? Thank you.","The $42 billion guidance includes market expectations of HIBOR implied above 2% in third quarter. So we’ve already said that HIBOR at a 1% impacts us by $100 million per month, so if you look overall, our HIBOR expectations as well as the impact of the $100 million – all these are included when you look at our overall confidence in the BNII guidance for the year. The BNII guidance is not just based on the forward curves. As we know, in Q2, very low HIBOR impacted us for around six to seven weeks. We have given more detail of it in the appendix, but a couple of things have moved around. The time deposits are now four points lower, and you look at those factors, and as we look for the rest of the year, there will be some upside and downside in terms of the timing of when the HIBOR shifts happen, as well as the dollar depreciation, how long it continues. In Q2, it was a tailwind for us. In terms of ECLs, so from an ECL perspective, we only give you the 2025 number. It’s fair to say that we have always in the last few years stayed between the 30 to 40 basis points, sometimes a bit to the upper end, so we’re not giving any guidance beyond 2025 at this stage.",,27.70929878950119,45.634358832104695,41.684965303424455,12.291098660322515,33.20347426528389,38.91246131612838,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Credit risk
2.0,"Two questions: the first one is related to tariffs. You gave guidance of 5% impact on revenues and I just wanted to see how we should think about that going forward, as you don’t see anything in the numbers today. And the second question is related to stage 1 and stage 2 movements. Clearly, your stage 2 has deteriorated. You discuss PDs, which have been adjusted, and I’m trying to understand a little bit more detail around your movements, in particular in the corporate and commercial bank, in terms of potential realised losses, but also model adjustments versus environment.","On tariffs, first, tariffs have never been a new feature of global trade. They have always been there, although we have seen recently a more significant shift in the US tariff policy. That’s created more uncertainty but, at the same time now, we’re encouraged to see that more agreements are being concluded, and this is giving us ideally more certainty as we look into the future. There are important things to call out. One, as you did see from our Q2 results, our trade Fee and other income has grown by 4%, and the reasons are multiple. First, we are positioned across some of the fastest growing trade corridors on the planet, specifically the ones in Asia or between Asia and the Middle East and various parts of the world where trade continues to grow significantly higher trends than some of the more traditional trade corridors and we have a leadership position across these intra-Asia, Asia-Middle East corridors. Second is we kept investing at pace in our services trade sector and now we have capabilities there and we’re able to capture much faster growth in the services trade sector than what has been the growth exhibited in the goods trade sector and that’s another area of strength for HBSC. Third, even in trade so far that the US is involved in, imports into the US, some of the unique propositions we’ve put forward such as TradePay have given unique support to US importers in helping them manage their working capital facilities and helping them meet the duties they are due to pay for tariffs in a way that allowed us to continue growing our business and gaining share. You put all of this together – you put the expertise we have with more than 5,000 trade specialists across more than 50 markets where we operate – and you can see the resilience of our business to uncertainty. Actually, it is a period where we can differentiate, continue gaining market share, deepening customer relationships, acquiring more customers and this is what we envisage for the expertise we have and the strength we have in our trade business. With regards to scenarios, I would like Pam to take you through it, but remember some of these scenarios are including extreme market movements such as interest rates at 1% which have material impact beyond the pure trade impact on our business.",,23.86943131685257,42.12842287427847,34.587865408316425,31.743112605518327,36.15313362937107,35.28130104024376,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Capital adequacy

It seems that you conduct a VIU test every quarter, but you don’t charge impairments every quarter. It seems that the impairment charges always come together with other bad news. When you first charge the VIU impairment in the fourth quarter of 2023, you got French disposal loss, you got a slight miss on the cost control, so you charged the first time and, in this quarter, you got the BoCom dilution impairment. I also cover Chinese banks. Their fundamentals are weak, but there were no sudden drops in fundamentals in the second quarter. It seems that VIU impairment charges always come together with other bad news. Can you share with us a little bit more colour on the factors triggering that kind of VIU impairment charge?","With Hong Kong CRE, the first thing, as you may expect, is we know this market very well. We’ve been in Hong Kong for 160 years, involved in the sector, and we’re comfortable with the position in this market. That’s very important to call out. Specifically, as regards residential development, this has stabilised. This has stabilised and we’re encouraged by that. It’s stabilised mostly because of policy support measures that have been taken, as well as because of a robust rental market more recently but, when we look wider in the CRE space, specifically around the office CRE space in Hong Kong, we’re still struggling because of some oversupply in this space. We are encouraged by some additional government action taken to restrict land sales and office CRE and this should work its way into the medium term by restricting supply and supporting the recovery of pricing in this space, but there will be some short-term pressure. Of the exposure we have on Hong Kong CRE, we basically called out less than 5% of it – around $1.5 billion of that exposure – where we continue to look with focus and attention. That $1.5 billion is to the weak borrowers that are either sub-standard or credit impaired, where the long- term value of the collateral is above 70%. Against this $1.5 billion, we have a $0.5 billion ECL. It gives you a quantum of what a worst case scenario in this space can be and that is the segment we’re looking at. Across the wider spectrum on Hong Kong CRE, what I can say is our mission is obviously to continue to support our customers as they work through some of the short-term challenges they’re going through but, in the medium to long term, we remain confident in the supply/demand dynamic in Hong Kong and the appeal of Hong Kong real estate at large and, therefore, remain constructive and optimistic about the medium to long term. The comment I want to make on BoCom is it’s purely coincidental. There is no correlation whatsoever between an accounting process related to the VIU process versus any other information, but remember the BoCom impairments have no CET 1 impact. They have no CET 1 ratio impact. They have, therefore, also no distribution impact in terms of dividend or share buyback, so I really encourage you to look at it as a pure accounting but no actual economic impact to the bank.",,48.30467423796654,55.352612618917995,46.30607709984976,31.096164929178684,44.25161821598215,52.7096357260612,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Evasive,Credit risk

That’s 42% of our limits. The increase that we have seen in the impaired book, you’re right. $600 million is largely to the secured side of the portfolio and the ECL stage 2 allowance increase is entirely due to models. Out of that, the charge we’ve taken of $400 million in the quarter, $100 million is due to the modelling charges. As Georges has said, the area we are most focused on is the sub-standard and the credit impaired side of the book, where the exposure if $1.4 billion. There is already an existing ECL charge of $500 million, so you can see further down what it means from an outlook perspective. Overall, when we have refreshed our ECL guidance, we obviously stress it with upside, downside and some fairly stringent requirements and we continuously monitor our book and we think that overall guidance that we have given in terms of around 40 basis points captures the entirety of the risk in the Hong Kong CRE book as we look at it now. On BoCom – and, as Georges said, of course we do not link impairment timing to anything else. It’s a routine quarterly accounting process. Again, we use our models. It’s a value-in-use model. It is very sensitive to input factors, so even a small shift in basis points can make it move up or down and, when we make an impairment, it’s because the fair value from the model is below the carrying value.

4.0,"I had a couple of questions, please – one on net interest income and one on costs. It’s a two-part question on NII. At face value, your banking NII guidance is circa $42 billion for the year. Given that you’re annualising at $43 billion at H1, that does actually imply a pretty marked step off in net interest income in H2. I just want to query whether you really mean that or not? There’s obviously lots of moving parts at play here, but it implies a run rate for net interest income in H2, which I guess people will carry over into 2026. Is there an element of conservatism in that $42 billion? Is there just too much uncertainty around HIBOR? The second part of that first question, if I may, is: can you help me understand the levers that you’re pulling and are able to continue pulling from here to offset this HIBOR decline? I’m specifically thinking about deposit passthroughs. The second question is around costs, please. I’m just interested in how hard you are pushing the organisation right now to realise the cost savings because, outside in, I think you’re leading a bit of a quiet revolution across the firm, to the extent that you can, and I’m hopeful that you can realise additional cost savings over time. Georges, I’m really interested in your reflections. Are you running at maximum capacity now, in terms of what you’re trying to do? And just a modelling point. To me, next year – I think it should be flattish costs next year. I don’t think consensus has got that, but a 3.5% inflation rate on costs and the $1.1 billion of gross saves tells me it should be flat next year. If you can comment on that as well, that would be great. Thank you so much.","First, cost discipline is ingrained in the firm quarter after quarter, year after year. It’s a commitment we have to this discipline. It’s our confidence in our ability to meet the commitments we have and it’s the fact that we are on track on all the cost items, be it our underlying cost or the cost saves. That one doesn’t change. In terms of the cost takeout, the cost takeout that’s taking place now that we’re calling out is a cost takeout related to organisation simplification. Remember it is an intention to simplify the organisation, make us simple and agile, but there’s obviously an ancillary benefit, which is a cost reduction from de-duplication of roles with limited impact on our revenue generation capabilities. That one is moving at pace, and we just revised upwards the saves we can achieve this year towards the target of $1.5 billion which we will take to the bottom line and we expect to achieve by the full-year 2026. There’s another cost takeout, which is exiting of non-strategic activities. We announced seven exits since the Q1 results. These in total will add up to about $1.5 billion of cost takeout. About a third has already been announced. A third is being worked on and we intend, once these cost saves are achieved, to reinvest this into our core revenue growth areas, strategic areas where we have competitive advantage and can generate accretive returns, but these are not the only levers we have on costs. We continue working on our operating leveraging cost. As you know, efficiency and productivity drives including through GenAI, automation and other modernisation of our capabilities will continue as a matter of regular course of business and these improvements will continue helping us manage our costs. I’m not going to comment on 2026 – we have not guided to it – just given the amount of saves we expect to achieve from the simplification in 2026. On banking NII, the one comment I’d like to make is that we continue growing our deposit base and continue being extremely liquid to support growth in loan as and when our customers start investing again. We called out $83 billion growth in our deposits over the last 12 months. That’s a 5% growth in our deposit base and our deposits drive the lion’s share of our banking NII and that’s a very important lever in the growth potential we can achieve in banking NII in terms of volume growth.",,36.18336620926857,41.99489091491056,42.351627750512336,55.18514957137287,46.51055607893193,39.81556915029482,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Evasive,Direct,Interest rate risk / NII
4.0,"I had a couple of questions, please – one on net interest income and one on costs. It’s a two-part question on NII. At face value, your banking NII guidance is circa $42 billion for the year. Given that you’re annualising at $43 billion at H1, that does actually imply a pretty marked step off in net interest income in H2. I just want to query whether you really mean that or not? There’s obviously lots of moving parts at play here, but it implies a run rate for net interest income in H2, which I guess people will carry over into 2026. Is there an element of conservatism in that $42 billion? Is there just too much uncertainty around HIBOR? The second part of that first question, if I may, is: can you help me understand the levers that you’re pulling and are able to continue pulling from here to offset this HIBOR decline? I’m specifically thinking about deposit passthroughs. The second question is around costs, please. I’m just interested in how hard you are pushing the organisation right now to realise the cost savings because, outside in, I think you’re leading a bit of a quiet revolution across the firm, to the extent that you can, and I’m hopeful that you can realise additional cost savings over time. Georges, I’m really interested in your reflections. Are you running at maximum capacity now, in terms of what you’re trying to do? And just a modelling point. To me, next year – I think it should be flattish costs next year. I don’t think consensus has got that, but a 3.5% inflation rate on costs and the $1.1 billion of gross saves tells me it should be flat next year. If you can comment on that as well, that would be great. Thank you so much.","Cost discipline will very much continue, not just into 2026, but further on as well and we also said earlier we will continue to invest in ways of increasing our productivity and that will be something which will be a priority for us. That’s something we can control and we have shown you a good track record in the first few quarters. We continue to focus on that. Coming down to banking NII - you’re right - around $42 billion. You may deem it to be conservative, if you just do the simple arithmetic, in terms of what the run rate takes us to and this quarter we had obviously the headwind from HIBOR, but it was offset to some extent by a weaker US dollar. The timing of how long the US dollar depreciation continues and on HIBOR also is important. We are assuming that there will be a sharp normalisation of HIBOR within this quarter to around the 2% mark. Obviously, any delay, even this delay of the month of July costs $100 million at a 1% HIBOR. What we will have as a benefit still coming in the rest of the year is the structural hedge, which is a tailwind. We’ve got a reinvestment of $55 billion in the second half at 2.8%. We have to reinvest and there’s an improvement of 2% on that in terms of the reinvestment rates as they stand, so that obviously is a tailwind. The balance sheet growth has been a real positive and it’s mainly driven by deposits. Our Hong Kong time deposit migration in a lower interest rate was four points into Q2, but obviously this can move up or down. In terms of levers to offset the HIBOR pressures, the Hong Kong time deposits were repriced. We also saw some balance sheet growth happening, because part of the weakness of the HIBOR was because of the strong Southbound connecting flows into Hong Kong and that immediately gave us the benefit to our deposit line. We have been also active in Markets Treasury. The benefit of that goes into Fee and other income. All in all, there are a number of areas in which we can pull levers to be very confident on our around $42 billion guidance for banking NII but, as always, we will be conservative, realistic, and if we out-perform, we out- perform.",,35.98217332363129,39.13245705940214,34.77902752216649,12.136153382569113,28.682545988045916,37.95110065848807,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Interest rate risk / NII
5.0,"I have two questions. The first is about the non-interest income. I’ve seen that HSBC delivered quite strong non-interest income in both quarter one and quarter two, primarily driven by the wealth management FX and the capital markets-related business. I wonder how you see the sustainability of this momentum going forward. The second question is about the stablecoin, because there are several countries and areas that have introduced stablecoin-related regulations. How does HSBC view the cryptocurrency area? Do you have some reservations in this area, or will you maintain a cautious approach in this area?","On digitised means of payment, we have launched tokenised deposit services for our wholesale customers. It’s live in Hong Kong and Singapore. It will be live in September in the UK and in the Eurozone and then early in 2026, it’ll be live in a number of other countries, including the US, the UAE and others. This will allow our wholesale customers – and is already allowing our wholesale customers – to do cross-border transactions with their suppliers or the other counterparties on a real-time basis and on an ‘always on’, as in 24/7, basis. That service is live and is developing and we continue investing in it. It’s programmable and it basically leverages the blockchain technology. We’re very pleased with this development. Beyond what we already offer in terms of tokenised deposits, we are watching very closely the regulatory developments around stablecoin. We are very encouraged about Hong Kong, indeed, issuing regulation there. Obviously, the US, with the GENIUS bill, is publishing regulation there. What we will monitor, one, is that the regulation addresses all our regulatory- related concerns, such as financial crime, prudential and other risks. We will also monitor the issuers of stablecoin and their compliance with these regulations and then, subject to those, we will evaluate all potential banking services we can do with them or customers involved with these issuers. We expect to move at pace. With regards to other crypto, at this stage, we have no appetite to be involved in other kind of algorithmic or other non-pegged cryptocurrencies. As an asset class, we still do not have risk appetite to be involved in that space. With regards our non-NII, there are a few comments I want to make and I’ll hand over to Pam. It’s a very important area for us. It’s a very important investment area for us. Let me talk about first transaction banking. We have a leadership position. We’re a top two player in global transaction banking. In payments and FX and trade – we’re the trade bank – for seven or eight consecutive years, the largest trade bank. It’s an area of unique strength, unique expertise. It’s an area of continued investment, both in digital capabilities and customer servicing, and we continue to see this area as resiliently growing, as demonstrated by 5% growth in Q2, of which 4% growth was within trade itself. That resilient underlying growth is due to the fact that we continue deepening customer relationships, gaining market share and acquiring new customers through all our expertise and our investment. The second one I want to talk to is wealth – six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Our target there is to grow in the medium term at double-digit rates, but that could be volatile a quarter to quarter, based on market conditions. This is also an area of active investment with intent. Our footprint, our brand, our heritage in Asia and the Middle East in particular give us unique strength to be able to accelerate this growth and continue gaining market share, benefitting from the underlying growth in the market. We’ve demonstrated a number of initiatives that we’ve already rolled out, be it in Wealth Centres, relationship managers or technology capabilities, digital capabilities we’ve been rolling out to our customers. Last, but not least, Capital Markets and Advisory, our debt and equity trading – all of whom have benefited also from our focused investment and our capabilities to be more meaningful and relevant for our customers and deliver growth as we did also in Q2.",,44.182911574840546,41.811629094588156,42.54697771131622,20.884047468788193,35.08088475823086,42.700860024682804,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Capital adequacy

As Georges has said, it’s been a focus area and we’ve seen strong performance, albeit, in the last two quarters, there has been the tailwind of market conditions and it’s hard to predict when these transactional tailwinds will fade away. Nevertheless, if you look at the various parts that build up to this Fee and other income, FX was up 7% - a very strong position in FX. There’s a baseline that will always be a growth engine. Investment Distribution was up 24%. Private Banking was up 12%, and there are also other annuity revenues, which are like our net new invested assets, which are up $75 billion over the last four quarters, so not really helped just by tailwinds, and also, the insurance CSM balance is at record levels, and that’ll just drip into the P&L over time, so that’s also like an annuity. Now, there’s just one or two items which I would call one-offs or specifically volatile beyond the transactional tailwinds. One is the Argentina hyperinflation, which was the $200 million impact in Q2 of 2024. Obviously, it was not a repeat in Q2 of 2025, but with Argentina gone, that is not going to be again coming into the comparison. And the other was the $100 million related to Markets Treasury activity, and that will be volatile. It will change from quarter to quarter. So overall very comfortable with the core of the growth, with some moves from quarter to quarter.",,28.574240505695343,44.73417956676642,40.37647183042139,36.959402015001864,40.690017804063224,38.674202418864766,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Capital adequacy

The key thing that we look at every quarter and we looked at the last year-end as well, is valuations. Now, valuations is an ongoing process. You see the valuations in terms of orderly valuations, but the valuations also get impacted even on the performing book when you see some distressed valuations. And already, we had started considering distressed valuations as part of our ECL charge for the year-end by giving some probability for those distressed valuations, and this lag on a performing book, because the book is still performing on the valuations as it comes as part of our credit processes – we do a read-across to the book. Now, generally, the LTVs have remained strong, so just to say the LTVs which have gone higher than 70% is still a very small portion of the book, but while we are focused on this, we are, as in every quarter, looking at the rest of the book. The real challenge continues with the over-supply in the office space. Now, it’s not across everywhere the same. It depends upon the location of the office space; it depends upon the quality of the building. Has it been new, refurbed, or otherwise? So that’s the piece that we also then bear in mind when we look at the valuation shift, to say, ‘Is there any greater calibration or divergence from the kind of property, the use of property?’ And the overall liquidity in the market, in terms of actual transactions, has been relatively low.",,33.4634091258049,42.21335310533025,44.20000159700869,17.56185489721314,34.658403199850696,38.93212411300824,2025,Q2,Evasive,Direct,Direct,Direct,Capital adequacy
7.0,"I have two, please. The first is on FX. It’s good to see strong growth all across non-banking NII, but on FX, you called out good growth, but I wonder, we’ve seen some unusual currency volatility in the quarter; did that not lead us to generate above normal FX growth, and at 7%, would you call it above normal? So what were clients’ feedback? Were they churning portfolios more, hedging, etc, during the quarter, on FX? Because I see, Q on Q, also, it’s down. And then, on loan growth, we see some pick-up in the UK book, but then, in Hong Kong, China region, with the lower interest rates, are we seeing client demand come back in for loan growth, and how do we see the outlook there? Thank you.","Yes, FX has benefited from increased customer activity due to higher volatility. This is something that is difficult to forecast, but what is important to note is that it remains one of our core capabilities in transaction banking, and we remain one of the top players, I would say top two global players, in this space, and therefore, we do have a leadership market share in this space and capture client activity. It’s difficult to forecast what kind of volatility we may see going forward in Foreign Exchange, but we will continue being one of the main counterparties to support our customers’ hedging activities. On loan growth, I was actually particularly encouraged with the UK Commercial banking corporate loan growth. It’s early to call it a trend, $3.5 billion growth, but it is definitely a green shoot in this space where it has been subdued for many quarters now. So we have seen the UK credit book remain very resilient through the last few years, but we haven’t seen it grow, and hopefully, with more clarity about the UK and the tariffs related to the UK, we can see more investments taking through. The additional comment I would like to make about the UK specifically and then hand over to Pam is that we’re very encouraged by the UK having also moved at pace in their trade negotiations with trade agreements now concluded with the US, with the EU, since Brexit, and then more recently with India, which is a historic trade deal where we have a very vibrant business corridor going on between the UK and India.

From a loan growth perspective, so in Q1, we saw growth in Asia, ex Hong Kong, China. And that’s been stable, but it’s moving along, and obviously, Q2, given some of the tariffs news, people were slower in terms of making their decisions. In the UK, our growth was good, but also, our focus was very much across sectors which were growing, so whether it’s in the infrastructure space and so on. So we were very focused, and that held up well. We are doing the same engagement level on our customers across the globe, and from a growth perspective, at the back of the interest rates coming down, the other factor which is very important, and we’ve called it out before, is macro uncertainty. So, when this macro uncertainty continues, the capex decisions are delayed. However, from a working capital, we see some early engagement where people are looking at how they shift and change some of their business models, and so on. What I do want to say is that, overall, where we have good benefits still coming through from our NII line is our deposit base, which is, as I’ve called out, up $83 billion year on year, so that stays a very strong component, as part of our NII business. And I would say, from an FX perspective, the other thing to bear in mind is we’re seeing strong flows into Hong Kong through the depressed HIBOR, so that is another factor to balance overall in our outlook.",,19.009716510772705,44.583473702102644,36.28399346952681,67.41207797351153,49.42651504838033,34.99331475535392,2025,Q2,Direct,Direct,Evasive,Direct,Capital adequacy

So the capabilities will be extended, but will be expanded in a way where we remain very comfortable with the KYC considerations to be able to onboard them as clients or future clients. We are looking, obviously, at stablecoin developments. We believe it is still early to understand how some of these stablecoin issuers are able to KYC the wider client base.
