0,1.0,"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment. Got it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the... ...elevated macro uncertainties. That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.

Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?","Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is. Oh, yeah. Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital. Okay. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed. Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there.

The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point."
1,2.0,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you. Hey, thanks. Good morning.

And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you. Okay. But I guess just one follow-up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice? Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.","Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.

I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent."
2,3.0,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.

The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed. Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.","Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.

So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit. Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period. And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%."
3,4.0,"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice? Hi, thanks.

Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter? Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.","Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact. Yeah.

4,5.0,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks. Okay.

Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks. Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently.","Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale. It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you.

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way."
5,6.0,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve. Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve. Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?","Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%. Yeah.

I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever."
6,7.0,"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve? Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.

I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.

7,8.0,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks? Hey. Good morning.

You may proceed.","Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it. If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds.

In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah."
8,9.0,"No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment? Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.

Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.","I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time. Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre- existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now. I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time. Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle.

Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side."
9,10.0,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think? In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%.

Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think? That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too? Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is. Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard.

Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point. And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here."
10,11.0,"Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there? Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there? Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?","No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment. No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment. Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter."
11,12.0,"Leverage loan-type items or just regular Corporate credits? Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. Leverage loan-type items or just regular Corporate credits? Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as well? Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Regular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail... …Gerard. Sorry. Thanks. Regular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail... …Gerard. Sorry. Thanks. Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across. Steve, you there? Operator: It looks like his line dropped so next we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. You may proceed."
12,13.0,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up? Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up? Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. Can I just add also, housing is in short supply in America. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008. Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue. Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets.

So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue. Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization. Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome. We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if those things could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best."
13,14.0,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time?

And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers. Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer.

That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers. Yeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vice Chair Barr's speech, right? He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix. There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So we'll see, we'll see what happens. I would just add to that. Even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by product, by client, and by effectively business mix, and those need adjustments. Roughly, loans don't make sense to put on your balance sheet as a whole, almost any loan, and people have to recognize that. And so we just manage through all the various complications here and figure out what the hell to do."
14,15.0,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads?

And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks. Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?","Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here. Yeah, Mike.

Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider."
15,16.0,"All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly? All right.

Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not? Wait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years, going back to it. And then last quick follow-up...","Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward. Well, it's two really different questions.

All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward. Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right? Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them don't. Mike, I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance, auto market, bankers, recruiters, traders – Mike, this is it. We're full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful.

16,17.0,"Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what? All right. Thank you. Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what? All right. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're getting closer? Alright. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity. Yeah.

But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement."

I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets NII... Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.","Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped. Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped. Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit."
18,19.0,"No, hear me? Hello? No, hear me? Hello? Helpful color, and just a follow-up on Card income. Revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure. Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.","Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card income isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves."
19,20.0,"Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question. Okay.

You may proceed.","Go ahead, Jeremy. And then I'll go. Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines. Go ahead, Jeremy. And then I'll go.

20,21.0,"Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now? And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting? Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take your comments to mean that you're on pause now? And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting? Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.","Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it's cheap, not just when it's available. And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of cautious. So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know. Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it's cheap, not just when it's available. And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of cautious. So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know. Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?"
21,22.0,"Yeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for those? Got it. This is based on the current rule set. I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it. Yeah.

I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it. Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside – or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system? Appreciate that, Jeremy. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review. And it's going to take a lot of time to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know. And there were supposed – I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller. The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for loans. Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them. I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally. Yes. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.

I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter."
22,23.0,"Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments. Thank you.

I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is. So then…","Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us. When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I think they have already – as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers. Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of.

But I think they have already – as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers. Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion. All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy."
23,24.0,"Interesting. Just follow-up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations. What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 years? Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.

What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 years? Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.","We've got our smartest people, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference. And we've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships. You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too. We've got our smartest people, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference.

You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain assets, too. Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the- cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion."
24,25.0,"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought? Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought? Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII longer-term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right? Got it.","Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so. It's normalization. It's a good thing for us. Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so. It's normalization. It's a good thing for us. Yes, but let me emphasize something on that. Go ahead, Jamie. Yeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 bps, I mean, whatever the product is, yeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up, that $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again. Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate Wholesale to Consumer. Yeah. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed."
25,26.0,"Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about really just going security-by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching… Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in – you guys took some securities losses again this quarter. And in the past you've talked about really just going security-by-security looking for, kind of, pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader, overarching… Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that? Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade-off that eventually you'll... Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","That'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives. Sell what we find rich, and we buy what we think is dear... Cheap. Cheap. That'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives. Sell what we find rich, and we buy what we think is dear... Cheap. Cheap. Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead. I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business, and not in other parts. Yeah. Matt, it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. That's the core of the strategy. But that's a little more complicated because a lot of that loan-to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, etcetera. Thanks. Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed."

JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?","Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to."
27,28.0,"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.","Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be."
