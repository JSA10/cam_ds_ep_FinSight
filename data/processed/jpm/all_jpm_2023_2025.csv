presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter – implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted-average economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter- on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services and Auto – revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter, as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on- quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in capex spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets; and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run-rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,1,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,1,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,3,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,4,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Okay. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,2,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,3,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,3,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,3,1,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,Okay. Thank you very much. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,4,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,5,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,5,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale. It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,6,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,7,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,7,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things.",2023,Q1,True,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,7,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,7,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,7,2,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,8,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,8,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,9,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,9,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,9,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre- existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,9,2,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,10,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer.

qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,13,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,13,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,14,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,14,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,15,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets.

That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know.

I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide?

qa,16,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,17,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up.

qa,20,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,20,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line.

I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful.

And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system?

And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on.

qa,25,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.

qa,25,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit utilization are all in line with our expectations. Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into managed products. In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year- on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of $1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. The current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic) [$366] million. Expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned upfront. To finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The Firmwide NII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit, we expect the Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the markets and the broader economy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,2,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,2,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,3,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,3,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is. I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,4,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,7,,Matt O’Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend?

qa,7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment.

qa,9,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,9,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,9,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,10,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,11,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable.

Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it. And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in.

Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done.

qa,13,,Ebrahim Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty.

And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough?

Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now.

I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter.

We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean – and the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change that we've never seen in our lives.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,18,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,18,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans. Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there.

qa,19,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,"Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a ""Deep recognition of flaws"" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation. But before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars ""Get over it"" to this week say, ""Do something."" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened and do you really think next earnings call we'll be through most of the uncertainty?

qa,19,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade, so – and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it. I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They've said they want to do it. They've said they're having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages, if it's done right. I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages would come down 70 basis points.

It is also LCR, it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have the same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First Republic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations.

qa,21,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore Group LLC,"Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully. And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients.

qa,21,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down. But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,21,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss- calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment.

qa,22,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you – does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments? Or do you think that's just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,22,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,22,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Can I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. Okay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that.

Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter, led by Fixed Income and Equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $49 million, up $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gain. Expenses, $547 million, were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the Foundation contribution from the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now, let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Securities Services as well as balanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%. So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic, in many ways navigating uncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

Relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital. I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro, regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?

qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller.

And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is, it seems to me, the exact opposite of what we want.

Now, a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands, but that's always true.

Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing.

Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper-single digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,12,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted I think previously, and as you see coming through the IB fee performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public, and some of that is on our balance sheet and we're very happy to have it there.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years.

qa,14,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yes, and I would put securitizations in that category.

I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk.

qa,18,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hey, good morning. Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III Endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked, 17% through-the-cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE?

Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say, it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, “Your margin is my opportunity.” That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera.

And the second question I had is, you mentioned and clearly we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it – did activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess, I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients' thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

Maybe just on – Jeremy, if I look at your 10-Q and 10-K rate sensitivity disclosures, it looks like you guys have done a lot to reduce your asset sensitivity to the short end of the curve. So, can you talk about what you've been doing to change the positioning of the balance sheet, whether extending duration or hedges?

So, that’s worth saying out loud. But, I mean, you can decrease volatility, but it's just a question of now or later. But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did in fact add some duration this quarter, with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit, so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes and like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,21,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators look at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheets into lower risk assets. Do you see that, is it really just a supply issue or how do you think about the demand-supply dynamic, and is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower margin areas. Just your thoughts.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point, so I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized, because I think everyone's assuming it will go in roughly in its current form.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

In terms of the competitive landscape, I think a thing that we feel really great about is the dramatic increase in the customer value proposition associated with the card.

We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. Obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we should expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway, but we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate, and then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now, of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But a thing I like to remind myself of, to your point is that, while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot.

As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact.

Look, I'm completely convinced if you take out of your mindset 12 months, we will use the capital wisely for shareholders.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,29,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the one-time effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was – excuse me, guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some one-time – not one-time items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially – I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,29,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Jeremy can answer this, but this will be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we can not just earn 17% ROTCE and that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17%, you’re a bond. You will trade three times tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so, the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your business, which we are doing. If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers and internationally. And when you look at the midcap business we're doing in Europe, it's been great. Innovation Economy has been great. We're gaining shares in lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the International Private Bank, payment systems. We’re investing in all those things to grow our franchises and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that.

qa,29,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. And Gerard, I guess on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable, and I feel like it's kind of all of the above. Let me say what I mean. Like, on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right. Rates are at a good level for us, deal activity is high, capital markets are very strong, consumer credit is excellent, wholesale credit is excellent, wealth management, asset management, essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders, with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse; and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well, and we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about.

qa,31,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. I just want to follow-up on Ken's question about sales and trading. And I think you kind of addressed this, Jeremy, but I just – you’ve had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional Q1 on the back of a really strong 2024. I mean, how are you thinking about how much of this really is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable and presumably less volatility, good for investment banking. But do you see – would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result? Or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share?

qa,31,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So, it's pretty broad based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So, I guess, on the one hand you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially. So, I mean, we've gotten, over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before we get into the discussions about third quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $4.8 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million, or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion, or 9%, year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now starting on page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time. The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis-calibrated originally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lense on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Capital Buffer. Although there's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have been adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how over calibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the overall capital framework. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III Endgame consistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB, would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends, with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on- quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were up $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion, on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In Advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets – total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed Income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit. This was predominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. And Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year- on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows of higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

And we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,3,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September.

qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,5,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,6,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when.

qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,8,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.

qa,10,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,11,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest- bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,11,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,13,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,14,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things, what's going on in the world and their potential impact on markets, on food markets, global trade, everything that you mentioned, and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,14,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,14,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too when we figure out what to do.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,15,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that. And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark-to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,15,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point... Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

qa,15,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted.

It's obviously Marcus, it's Apple, it's Chime, it's Dave. There are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive.

But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots so they know to widen the client's coin or something like that.

And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets business specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event?

qa,19,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish. We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years.

In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing.

qa,1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,2,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Very helpful.

I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary.

That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March.

But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis.

All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that.

qa,5,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth.

qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other.

qa,6,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,7,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about?

qa,8,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better.

Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed?

You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever.

qa,11,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board.

qa,12,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,"BofA Securities, Inc.","And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may imply for deposit growth?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
qa,12,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.

You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion.

qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter – implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted-average economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter- on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services and Auto – revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter, as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on- quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in capex spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets; and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run-rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,4,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Okay. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed.,2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,4,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale. It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch. Operator: Thank you.

qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things.",2023,Q1,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,7,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,8,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment.

qa,9,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre- existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,10,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,13,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just add also, housing is in short supply in America. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,15,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,15,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,16,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,16,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? Are you talking contagion or what?",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,20,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve.

qa,20,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line.

I think now it feels like it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that.

The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for loans.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,22,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them. I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine.

qa,23,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,23,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,23,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I think they have already – as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers.",2023,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,25,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances.

qa,25,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1 – the firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $42.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a couple of highlights. Firmwide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB Wealth Management business. On page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results excluding First Republic – revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in Card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex. Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12%, driven by higher Firmwide Asset Management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year. Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC's special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $816 (sic) million, predominately driven by Card. On the balance sheet and capital, on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre-pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7%, as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher Card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs which were up $825 million year-on-year, predominately due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card, largely offset by a release in Home Lending. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8K with historical results including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the re-organization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions, with debt up 58% and equity up 51%. In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in Rates and Commodities compared to a strong prior-year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower legal expense. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year- on-year, driven by higher non-interest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year, with increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition as well as higher distribution fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year and client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were flat. Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year, predominately driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish up, we have the outlook on page 9. We now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business, and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income; we're just mentioning this to help with your models. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre- CCAR? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Excellent. Us too. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.,2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long- term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,4,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth – for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex.

qa,6,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome.

qa,7,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that’s the",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession.

qa,8,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here.

qa,10,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about, we'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with – as it relates to M&A on like go-no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because of it's knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect.

qa,11,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.

But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or months. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, consumer or wholesale payments. So, I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more.

qa,12,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that’s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don’t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world.

qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I think one of the things about Payments businesses is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the recession. We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, and that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece.

qa,14,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase that, what type of environment would have J.P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,15,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,16,,Matt O’Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,16,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,,Matt O’Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category? Either overall or among certain segments? Thank you.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,1,Matt O’Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.,2024,Q1,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.,2024,Q1,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,18,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,18,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,19,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,19,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,20,,Charles W. Peabody,analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,20,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,21,,Charles W. Peabody,analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.",2024,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit utilization are all in line with our expectations. Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into managed products. In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year- on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances. Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of $1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. The current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic) [$366] million. Expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned upfront. To finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The Firmwide NII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit, we expect the Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the markets and the broader economy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer.

qa,2,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is. I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients.

qa,4,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment.

qa,7,,Matt O’Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.,2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment.

qa,9,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it. And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in.

Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done.

I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough?

I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now.

Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter.

I think that given everything that's going on on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that.

I think some of those issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months. So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession.

That is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean – and the China issue is a major issue.

qa,18,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,18,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans. Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there.

qa,19,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,"Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a ""Deep recognition of flaws"" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation. But before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars ""Get over it"" to this week say, ""Do something."" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened and do you really think next earnings call we'll be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,19,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade, so – and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it. I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They've said they want to do it. They've said they're having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages, if it's done right. I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages would come down 70 basis points.

qa,19,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"If you do all – you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system.

That used to be 100%, and the reason for that isn't – it's not just capital. It is also LCR, it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have the same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First Republic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations.

And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk?

qa,21,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore Group LLC,"Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully. And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients.

qa,21,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down. But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,21,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss- calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment.

qa,22,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs since nobody has asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you – does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments? Or do you think that's just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,22,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.",2025,Q1,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,22,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Can I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. Okay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25%. These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio of $1.2 billion as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights: CCB client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM, and we ranked number one in IB fee wallet share. Before giving you more detail on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition. Now turning back to this quarter's results on page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the Firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, $599 million of expense, and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR in the Corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex. Markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items primarily in the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up $1.5 billion or 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in Corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio. And as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4% and it goes into effect in 4Q23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter. On liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our Earnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So when we release this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100- basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have been about negative $1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion, which was up 31% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher-yielding products. Client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto, originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of $8.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, our credit costs were $1.5 billion, reflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on- year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day-plus delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.5 billion was up 11% year-on-year or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In Advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed Income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior-year quarter, particularly in derivatives. Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 million was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing. CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior-year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation, and the impact of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to Corporate on page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last year. NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year-on-year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction. Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both Consumer and Wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out. Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. But I guess just one follow-up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And so my follow-up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. It’s still 5.8%.,2023,Q2,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,Okay. And there's some room for buybacks?,2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,1,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,Okay. Thank you.,2023,Q2,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sorry, John. Go ahead. Did you have a follow-up?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Yeah. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically? Do you episodically buy back?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.,2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point. And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Ken Usdin,analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as well?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,13,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome. We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if those things could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession.

qa,14,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix. There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners.

qa,15,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech.

qa,15,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech.

qa,16,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,16,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far.

qa,18,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,18,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,19,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period.

qa,21,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on.

qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details.

qa,22,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside – or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,22,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago.

But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,24,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the- cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far.

qa,26,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,26,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds.

qa,27,,Charles W. Peabody,analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,27,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,27,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,28,,Charles W. Peabody,analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity?

qa,28,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.",2023,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Excluding these items, the Firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up 10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and Card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior-year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also, in the prior-year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line of business. Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex. Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic-related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher Investment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. Excluding the Foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and $189 million in Wholesale. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally, the Firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on- quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In Home Lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior-year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit-related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued strength in Securitized Products. And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record revenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security Services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation, legal expense, and volume-related non-compensation expense. In Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and pay-off activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in Office. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.3 billion, with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year, and client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year. Excluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic-related expense out of Corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on page 8. Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex. Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. So, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income, or more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And, as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,3,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc","Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that. And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor.

Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still – it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend.

qa,7,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,9,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII.

So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers.

I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable.

I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company.

And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,18,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi, good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,18,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,18,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,19,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,19,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.",2024,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"names, partially offset by the scenario probability adjustment I mentioned upfront. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter, led by Fixed Income and Equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $49 million, up $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gain. Expenses, $547 million, were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the Foundation contribution from the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now, let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Securities Services as well as balanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%. So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic, in many ways navigating uncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,,Christopher McGratty,analyst,"Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. Relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital. I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro, regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing? Thank you.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit; private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happening? Is that a good thing for America?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"And so, I just – it is time that they take a step back. I hear sometimes from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"And maybe sort of gone a bit long here, but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there. I will note that Vice Chair Bowman, gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is, it seems to me, the exact opposite of what we want. So, that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,3,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"So, two questions. First on the RWA utilization via organic, as you described. I wanted to understand in wholesale lending where you highlighted, the CIB was a driver of much of this. Could you speak to the drivers of those drivers? In other words, is it private credit?

qa,4,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Oh, great. All right. Thank you.

We don't know exactly – I think they're real, but I don't know why you'd want a stablecoin as opposed to just payment. But I do think you have fintech. These guys are very smart. They're trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts and get into payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved.

qa,5,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Super. And then, separately on the topic of open banking, I think that's on hold right now with the CFPB, on hold right now. But just wanted to understand, does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"So, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they – do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn’t be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so, we're kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the systems protection. So, we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it. The last thing is a liability shift. I mean, I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it, and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that. And if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility on their part so we can all do a better job for the customer.

So, let's do consumer quickly. I think we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just – the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now, a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands, but that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations.

Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing. Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period.

qa,12,,John McDonald,analyst,Truist Securities Inc.,"Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits, maybe in the context of Marianne's presentation from Investor Day. Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper-single digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,13,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. Hey, Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography?

Thanks.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted I think previously, and as you see coming through the IB fee performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public, and some of that is on our balance sheet and we're very happy to have it there.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"To answer your other question, Mike. So, some of the – I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,14,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yes, and I would put securitizations in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk.

But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did in fact add some duration this quarter, with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit, so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes and like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point, so I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized, because I think everyone's assuming it will go in roughly in its current form.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

And in particular, one of the things that we look at is the ratio of the customer value to the annual fee which is clearly market leading at this point.

And I think the point actually sort of to your question is that, yes, we are seeing opportunities to deploy capital and other resources; and yeah, maybe at the margin that does contribute a little bit to durability. We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. Obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we should expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway, but we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate, and then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now, of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But a thing I like to remind myself of, to your point is that, while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot. So, we are deploying a lot of capital and other resources in this business, and we're earning good returns on it, but the revenue growth is not coming for free.

qa,26,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore Group LLC,"Hi, thanks. Just two quick follow ups. On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines, I know we've been here before and markets can giveth and taketh away, but there is a time value in there, meaning corporates and more importantly sponsors need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time? We've been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now.

qa,27,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Okay. Wait, I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn. So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact. So, that's all to the good in some sense. Now the other part of your question, can you just repeat it?

qa,29,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the one-time effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was – excuse me, guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some one-time – not one-time items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially – I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,29,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"Jeremy can answer this, but this will be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we can not just earn 17% ROTCE and that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17%, you’re a bond. You will trade three times tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so, the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your business, which we are doing. If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers and internationally. And when you look at the midcap business we're doing in Europe, it's been great. Innovation Economy has been great. We're gaining shares in lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the International Private Bank, payment systems. We’re investing in all those things to grow our franchises and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that. That is the best way to use it.",2025,Q2,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,29,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. And Gerard, I guess on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable, and I feel like it's kind of all of the above. Let me say what I mean. Like, on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right. Rates are at a good level for us, deal activity is high, capital markets are very strong, consumer credit is excellent, wholesale credit is excellent, wealth management, asset management, essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders, with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse; and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well, and we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about.

So the notion that somehow we're not going deal with our competitors, which protects JPMorganChase, we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day. And so, we're quite cautious to just declare victory like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever.

And I think you kind of addressed this, Jeremy, but I just – you’ve had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional Q1 on the back of a really strong 2024. I mean, how are you thinking about how much of this really is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable and presumably less volatility, good for investment banking. But do you see – would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result? Or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share?

qa,31,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So, it's pretty broad based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So, I guess, on the one hand you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before we get into the discussions about third quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $4.8 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million, or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion, or 9%, year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now starting on page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time. The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis-calibrated originally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lense on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Capital Buffer. Although there's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have been adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how over calibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the overall capital framework. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III Endgame consistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB, would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends, with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on- quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were up $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion, on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In Advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets – total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed Income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit. This was predominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. And Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year- on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows of higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,John McDonald,analyst,Autonomous Research,"And just as a follow up, it seems like you’ve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,3,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color in the slides, so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.,2023,Q3,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when.

qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.

qa,10,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest- bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,11,1,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Great. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.,2023,Q3,True,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re-asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for- longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex. Markets and we're kind of saying...",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,$22.5 billion.,2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. Isn't that what I meant to say?,2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,4,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,She said $22.9 billion.,2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Oh, I didn't hear that, okay. Anyway...",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,6,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,We didn’t model it that way.,2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion, so that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,12,8,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I would just add quantitative tightening in there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect, where wholesale, consumer as – remember also the Fed has the RRP program which is also sucking money into the Fed directly and reducing deposits. That's still a trillion too.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal? So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,13,2,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Got it. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.,2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things, what's going on in the world and their potential impact on markets, on food markets, global trade, everything that you mentioned, and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,14,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too when we figure out what to do.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,15,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that. And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark-to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,15,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point... Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

qa,15,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted.

It's obviously Marcus, it's Apple, it's Chime, it's Dave. There are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive.

But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots so they know to widen the client's coin or something like that.

qa,19,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish. We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation.

qa,20,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,20,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,21,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher-than- expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run-off of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,21,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.",2023,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 on revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in Card and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex. Markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year’s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale. Net charge-offs were up $590 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, flat versus the prior quarter, as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We had $6.0 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares, as we have previously mentioned. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.0 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We're seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher NII, partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge-offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year-on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates. Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year-on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients’ access to receptive capital markets. In multi-family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets, and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior-year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion were up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, [year-on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year-on-year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of Markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,1,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,All right. Thanks a lot.,2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.,2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,2,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you actually go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that takes bankers and certain technology, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one. Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers...",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf

qa,3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,4,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.,2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,4,Steven Chubak,analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Steve. Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said. Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end. So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point.

qa,6,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf

qa,7,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,1,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,7,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strongly about.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf

We just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that.

qa,8,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis?

qa,8,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock.

qa,9,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,9,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open.

qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically.

You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf

But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right thing to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices.

Your line is open.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,14,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides.

We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,15,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,15,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf

And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue.

qa,23,1,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.,2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,24,,Saul Martinez,analyst,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.","Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf
qa,24,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40",2024,Q3,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf

qa,24,3,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%.

presentation,,,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Thank you and good morning everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. On page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB, to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense and $647 million of net income. Now focusing on the Firmwide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex. Markets was up $139 million or 1%, and Markets revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card and single name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the Commercial Bank. Looking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23 and revenue of $162 billion. And we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year-on-year, driven by strong account growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with average balances down 8% year-on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows – in fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending, revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year, and higher NII. Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14%, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share, while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, advisors and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs, which were up $791 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in Card. Next, the CIB on page 6. The CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year-on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year-on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. In Advisory, fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior-year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Fixed Income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our Securitized Products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue in Rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in Derivatives and Cash. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year- on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year- on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion, was up 2% year-on-year, driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $924 million, was up 32% year-on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by a deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million – with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances, partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives; continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition and the continued investment in Global Shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion – positive across Equities and Fixed Income – and $140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net inflows $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 million year-on-year. NII of $2.5 billion, was up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million, compared with a net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex. Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide, we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology, as well as marketing. Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with Investor Day guidance. So, in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over-earning, as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. But, despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments, and this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients and communities.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion.

qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile.

qa,3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%.

Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,4,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,5,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,6,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,6,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios – is a very strong labor market.

So, good question on the multi-family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no – no bleed-through. And the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi-family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multi-family portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets.

qa,8,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,10,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to AI and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short- term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,10,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that – I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,14,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition.

qa,14,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system- wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,15,,Manan Gosalia,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,15,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf

qa,17,,Glenn Schorr,analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?",2023,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf
qa,17,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients.

But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards.

qa,19,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics.

If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit.

I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do. I just wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then became co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world. And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company.

qa,1,,John McDonald,analyst,"Truist Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf

qa,1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,2,,John McDonald,analyst,"Truist Securities, Inc","Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,2,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,2,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Very helpful.

qa,3,,Mike Mayo,analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary.

That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question again?

So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet.

But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis.

All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just take a deep breath.

qa,5,,Jim Mitchell,analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular.

qa,5,1,"Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC",analyst,,"Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,6,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,6,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,7,,Erika Najarian,analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf

qa,8,,Matt O'Connor,analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income.

Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,8,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,9,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay.

qa,10,,Betsy L. Graseck,analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,10,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf

qa,11,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,"BofA Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,11,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,11,2,Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,JPMorganChase,"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,12,,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,analyst,"BofA Securities, Inc.","And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may imply for deposit growth?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,12,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.

qa,13,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,13,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorganChase,"That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",2024,Q4,False,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript.pdf
qa,14,,Gerard Cassidy,analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity?
