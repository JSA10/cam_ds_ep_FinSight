# Q1–Q2 2025 Regulatory Synthesis: JPM & HSBC

## 1. Thematic Focus & PRA Categories

### HSBC
- **Capital Adequacy**: Dominant concern, with high topic counts (Q1: 7; Q2: 6). Key topics include revenue growth, impairment, and hedge structures.
- **Conduct Risk**: Significant focus, with 11 topics in Q1 decreasing to 8 in Q2. Notable concerns around trade scenarios, tariffs, and China-related downside risks.
- **Governance**: Elevated attention (Q1: 14; Q2: 10), highlighting outliers and normalised impairment guidance.
- **Liquidity & Unmapped**: Stable in liquidity topics; however, unmapped topics (e.g., costs, Mexico business) show a sharp decline from 14 to 3, indicating reduced focus or evasiveness.

### JPM
- **Governance**: The most prominent theme, with an increase from 44 to 61 topics, emphasizing governance outliers and follow-up discussions.
- **Capital Adequacy**: Consistent high topic counts (Q1: 19; Q2: 42), with emphasis on Basel III, endgame, and client lending.
- **Conduct & Credit Risks**: Steady topics, with slight increases, reflecting ongoing risk assessments.
- **Unmapped**: Topics reduced from 8 to 3, but with high evasiveness, suggesting strategic opacity.

## 2. Sentiment Analysis & Divergences

### Banker vs. Analyst Tone
- **HSBC**: Banker sentiment remains highly positive (Q2: ~0.96–0.99), with minor fluctuations. Analysts exhibit more negative or neutral tones, especially in conduct and credit risk (Q1 negative scores ~0.99, Q2 dropping to 0), indicating potential evasiveness or cautiousness.
- **JPM**: Bankers are optimistic (Q2: ~0.97–0.99), while analysts show a stark contrast, with sentiment scores plummeting to zero in Q2 for several categories, notably conduct risk (from 0.96 to 0.00). This divergence suggests increased analyst skepticism or evasion.

### Sentiment Shifts
- **HSBC**: Slight positive shift in capital adequacy (+0.07), stable in other categories.
- **JPM**: Notable positive trend in governance (+0.17) and capital adequacy (+0.19), but analyst sentiment in conduct risk and market risk drops sharply, indicating potential strategic evasion or reporting gaps.

## 3. Summarisation & Evasion Hot-Spots

### Repeated Risks
- **Capital Adequacy**: Both banks exhibit high topic counts and evasion rates (~17–31), indicating persistent opacity.
- **Conduct & Credit Risks**: Elevated topic counts and evasion (~5–12), with HSBC showing increased evasiveness in credit risk (from 5 to 6) and JPM in operational controls (from 0 to 42).
- **Unmapped & Strategy**: JPM’s high evasiveness (21 topics, 21% rate) in unmapped areas and HSBC’s reduction in unmapped topics suggest strategic evasion hotspots.

### Evasion Hotspots & Examples
- **HSBC**: Highest evasion in Capital Adequacy (17%), Costs & Efficiency (6%), and Credit Risk (5%). Notably, Q2 evasion in Costs & Efficiency drops to zero, possibly indicating strategic suppression.
- **JPM**: Major evasion in Regulatory/PRA interactions (2 topics, 2%), and Operational Risk/Controls (from 0 to 42), indicating increased opacity in operational controls and regulatory engagement.
