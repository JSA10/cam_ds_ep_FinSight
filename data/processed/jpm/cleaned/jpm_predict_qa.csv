0,2025,Q1,1.0,1,"Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks. Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.","Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
2,2025,Q1,2.0,1,"Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion.

Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.","Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex.

Thanks.","So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale. The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind. Operator: Thank you.

10,2025,Q1,3.0,1,"Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn.

In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is. I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
14,2025,Q1,4.0,1,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here? Got it.

And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?","Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was – there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine.

32,2025,Q1,7.0,1,Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year. Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would say.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

46,2025,Q1,9.0,1,"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility? Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility.

But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?","Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

So we've seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in.

I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it. And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in.

We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession.

Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down.

Or do you think that's just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy.","Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well.

And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long.

I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital. I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro, regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing? Thank you. Great.

Thank you.","Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit; private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happening?

I will note that Vice Chair Bowman, gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is, it seems to me, the exact opposite of what we want.

Okay, because that's what I was going to try to clarify. Just wasn't sure if you were doing consumer, wholesale, or both. So, let's do consumer quickly. I think we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just – the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now, a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands, but that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations.

And in a world with 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio, to see a lot of weakness. Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing. Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period.

Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper-single digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about? Got it. Great. Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

And Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal? Thanks.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted I think previously, and as you see coming through the IB fee performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public, and some of that is on our balance sheet and we're very happy to have it there.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound?

We need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk.

So, that’s worth saying out loud. But, I mean, you can decrease volatility, but it's just a question of now or later. But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did in fact add some duration this quarter, with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit, so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes and like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

204,2025,Q2,21.0,1,"Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front.

You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point, so I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized, because I think everyone's assuming it will go in roughly in its current form.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. Obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we should expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway, but we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate, and then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now, of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But a thing I like to remind myself of, to your point is that, while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot.

Wait, I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn. So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact.

I don't think the answer is really knowable, and I feel like it's kind of all of the above. Let me say what I mean. Like, on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right. Rates are at a good level for us, deal activity is high, capital markets are very strong, consumer credit is excellent, wholesale credit is excellent, wealth management, asset management, essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders, with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse; and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well, and we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about.

I'm just curious how much – how you think about what's exceptional versus what's more durable here. That's fine. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator: Thank you.

I just want to follow-up on Ken's question about sales and trading.

Our final question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Yeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So, it's pretty broad based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So, I guess, on the one hand you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially. So, I mean, we've gotten, over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf

Your line is open.","It's obviously extremely client centric, there's a lot of financing of various types that's being supplied, and it seems to, if anything, more often than not be counter-cyclical rather than pro-cyclical. But it's still Markets, right? Things can happen, it's volatile, there's risk taking involved, that's part of the point that we build. Sorry to hedge the answer, but that's kind of how we think about it.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
274,2025,Q2,32.0,1,"Yeah. Good morning and thanks. Kind of an old school bank analyst question. After a long time of kind of bemoaning slow C&I loan growth, you had this extraordinary growth this quarter, $33 billion in average and more than 6% quarter-over-quarter. But then, when we look at the P&L in the Commercial & Investment bank, net interest income is down 2% and lending income is down 4%. And I know there's hedges and other complicated things, but it just kind of doesn't compute that you'd have such strong loan growth and not have revenue growth associated with that. Yeah.

I mean, the hedges are definitely part of it, and a lot of the assets came on the balance sheet quite late in the quarter, so I don't know, I might be missing something. There's probably some Markets it. There's Markets NII piece of it too. So, I don't know, Mikael can follow-up with you, but I think the loans thing is part of it, Markets NII is part of it, and late quarter…",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-2q25-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf
