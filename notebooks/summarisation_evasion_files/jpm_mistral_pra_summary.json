We need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk.\",\n\"I would say, it's not high on my list because we can do it ourselves and then you know buying people and comp plans.
