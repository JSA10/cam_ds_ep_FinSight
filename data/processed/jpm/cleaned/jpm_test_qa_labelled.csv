0,2023,Q4,2.0,1.0,"Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?","Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_2.0
1,2023,Q4,3.0,1.0,"Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?","Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside. Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%] peak of the current levels.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_3.0
2,2023,Q4,7.0,1.0,"And maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filter into multi-family apartments. You all have a pretty large multi-family exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed-through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you. Got it. . Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.","Yeah. So, good question on the multi-family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no – no bleed-through. And the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi-family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multi-family portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_7.0
3,2023,Q4,8.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis, net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June D-FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?","Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_8.0
4,2023,Q4,11.0,1.0,"Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I’ve asked you this before and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could AI make a difference? Just a little more meat on the tech bones. All right. Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that – I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_11.0
5,2023,Q4,15.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?","Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_15.0
6,2023,Q4,16.0,1.0,"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?","Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_16.0
7,2023,Q4,19.0,1.0,"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_19.0

And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_19.0
9,2024,Q4,1.0,2.0,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?","So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2024_Q4_1.0
10,2024,Q4,3.0,1.0,"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around? Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.","I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know.

We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that.

12,2024,Q4,5.0,1.0,"Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great. Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.","Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular.

As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?","So, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do.

14,2024,Q4,10.0,1.0,"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.","Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co.

15,2024,Q4,11.0,1.0,"Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.","Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever.

So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation.

Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital.

You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?","Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell.

As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve? Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.","Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_7.0

And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks?","Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere.

Or how you're thinking about the loan environment? Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre- existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_9.0
23,2023,Q1,10.0,1.0,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?","Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q1_10.0

So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_13.0

And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.","Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out.

A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows.

So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.","Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve.

It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes.

35,2023,Q2,1.0,1.0,"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace.

I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing.

37,2023,Q2,9.0,1.0,Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side.,"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_9.0

Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?","Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_11.0
39,2023,Q2,13.0,1.0,"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q2_13.0
40,2023,Q2,13.0,2.0,"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome. We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if those things could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_13.0
41,2023,Q2,17.0,1.0,"And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're getting closer? Alright. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_17.0
42,2023,Q2,18.0,1.0,"Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.","Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q2_18.0
43,2023,Q2,21.0,1.0,"Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.","Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details.

44,2023,Q2,24.0,1.0,"Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.","Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the- cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_24.0
45,2023,Q2,25.0,2.0,"Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII longer-term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right? Got it.","Yeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 bps, I mean, whatever the product is, yeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up, that $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_25.0

Got it.","Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate Wholesale to Consumer.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q2_25.0
47,2023,Q2,26.0,2.0,"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that? Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade-off that eventually you'll... Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of our business, and not in other parts.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_26.0
48,2023,Q2,27.0,1.0,"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?","Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_27.0

50,2023,Q2,28.0,1.0,"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.","Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_28.0

But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity?","Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_3.0
52,2023,Q3,5.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?","Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_5.0
53,2023,Q3,7.0,1.0,Want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalized next year or later on? Got it.,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out that it’s quite a bit lower than the current run rate.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_7.0
54,2023,Q3,10.0,1.0,"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?","Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.","In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_13.0

Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too when we figure out what to do.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_14.0
59,2023,Q3,15.0,1.0,"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that. And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark-to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?","Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point... Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted.

How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run-off of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?","Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run-off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over-earning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply to the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition, so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well arguably a little bit better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_21.0

And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%.

So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%.

It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store.

69,2024,Q1,2.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?","Yeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is: not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise, that continues. We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5% that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So, it's quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_2.0
70,2024,Q1,4.0,1.0,"Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growth – for the Card growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs?","Yeah, John. So, in short, yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low, if you map it to that expected Card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_4.0
71,2024,Q1,6.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.","I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q1_6.0

Like, how would you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank you. Helpful. Thank you so much.","Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that’s the",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_7.0

If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through.

74,2024,Q1,8.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?","Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away.

75,2024,Q1,11.0,1.0,"Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.","Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes.

Why is Wholesale Payments doing great? Alright. Thank you.","Well, I think one of the things about Payments businesses is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the recession. We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world, and that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_13.0
77,2024,Q1,15.0,1.0,"Cool. Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision environment, or maybe I should rephrase that, what type of environment would have J.P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through? Awesome. Thank you.","Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_15.0
78,2024,Q1,17.0,1.0,"Got it. And then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category? Either overall or among certain segments? Thank you.","Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_17.0
79,2024,Q1,20.0,1.0,"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question.","Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short-dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet; and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means, less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_20.0
80,2024,Q2,1.0,1.0,"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?","Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_1.0
81,2024,Q2,3.0,1.0,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?","Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things.

82,2024,Q2,4.0,1.0,"Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?","Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that. And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor.

83,2024,Q2,7.0,1.0,"Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing.

84,2024,Q2,8.0,1.0,"No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration. Super helpful. Thanks so much for that. Jeremy Barnum Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks, Glenn.","Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q2_8.0

I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin.

We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like, to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of.

I noticed on the average balances the non-interest- bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you’re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company.

And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I?

I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic.

So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view.

Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?","that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_18.0
93,2024,Q3,1.0,1.0,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks. All right. Thanks a lot.","Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_1.0
94,2024,Q3,3.0,1.0,"Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts? Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.","Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one. Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience.

Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio.

Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are.

We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock.

100,2024,Q3,9.0,1.0,"Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick-up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more, and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?","I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected.

One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically.

And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.","Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point at which you might buy the stock.

104,2024,Q3,14.0,1.0,"Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?","Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_14.0

There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides.

It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter.

And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward?
