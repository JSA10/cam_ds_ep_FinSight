JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",positive,0.9252972603,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.",positive,0.9867023826,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.",positive,0.9949855804,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Jefferies LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.",negative,0.7325242162,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",positive,0.9996071458,Conduct risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",positive,0.9973656535,Market risk
JPMorgan,Autonomous Research,2023,Q1,analyst,"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?",positive,0.9961519837,Conduct risk
JPMorgan,Autonomous Research,2023,Q1,analyst,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.",negative,0.9913305044,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale. It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.",positive,0.9909819961,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. And I think that the weighted-average peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",positive,0.9986519217,Stress testing
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?",positive,0.9432105422,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",positive,0.996352911,Stress testing
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the stickiness of it.",neutral,0.8143822551,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.",neutral,0.997772634,Market risk
JPMorgan,Seaport Global Securities LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment?",positive,0.7799574137,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre- existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",positive,0.5385704637,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Seaport Global Securities LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.,neutral,0.998775661,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?",positive,0.9994793534,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",negative,0.7594127655,Credit risk
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color there?",neutral,0.9977198243,Credit risk

JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2023,Q1,analyst,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up?",negative,0.9897303581,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.",positive,0.996355772,Market risk
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2023,Q1,analyst,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks.",positive,0.9673349857,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.",positive,0.4135858417,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.",positive,0.9990199804,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.",positive,0.9992265701,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.",positive,0.9042463899,Capital adequacy

JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2023,Q1,analyst,"Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.",positive,0.9979786277,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines.",positive,0.9884473681,Stress testing
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it's cheap, not just when it's available. And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of cautious.

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review.

The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for loans.",neutral,0.5047733188,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them. I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine.

JPMorgan,Evercore ISI,2023,Q1,analyst,"Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.",neutral,0.9522938728,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q1,banker,"When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash – so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on.

But Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn. So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?",positive,0.6254438758,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment. And I think we'll see what it is. I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",negative,0.7776122689,Credit risk
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2025,Q1,analyst,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?",positive,0.8918280602,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.",positive,0.9299521446,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Truist Securities Inc.,2025,Q1,analyst,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year, or just too early to call?",negative,0.6017848849,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Truist Securities Inc.,2025,Q1,analyst,"Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper?

And in the Chairman's letter, I wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any environment.

JPMorgan,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",2025,Q1,analyst,Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.,positive,0.9996473789,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would say.",positive,0.9912707806,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2025,Q1,analyst,"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the recent volatility?",positive,0.6474407911,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",positive,0.8197251558,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2025,Q1,analyst,"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.",positive,0.9232846498,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.",positive,0.9988774657,Market risk

JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2025,Q1,analyst,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility?",positive,0.8863943219,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"I mean that's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it. And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment, that will be great.",positive,0.9955621958,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole, and that was true before, and it's true now with this administration as well. Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let's see how that plays out, but we're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively.",positive,0.9276768565,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.",neutral,0.8018446565,Market risk
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2025,Q1,analyst,"Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great.",positive,0.9993506074,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",positive,0.9491225481,Market risk

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah. And the particular nuance, as you'll recall from last quarter, where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook, including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it's both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact, producing a potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth. I think that given everything that's going on on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the back-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run-rate perspective, introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year.

I think some of those issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months. So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared.

JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2025,Q1,analyst,"Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.",positive,0.999543488,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans. Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there.

And can you put – you or Jeremy, put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation. But before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars ""Get over it"" to this week say, ""Do something.""

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade, so – and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it. I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They've said they want to do it. They've said they're having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of loans and the cost of mortgages, if it's done right.

We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So, has something changed? Are the systems better?

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully. And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients.

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries. That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can go up or down and spreads can go up or down. But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too.

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about, for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic, obviously.",negative,0.9937945604,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q1,banker,"Can I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long. Okay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that.

Relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital. I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro, regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing? Thank you.",positive,0.9980143309,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.",negative,0.9487435222,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Can I say just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture. So, nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller.

I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive.

But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just – the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now, a few things are true like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands, but that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations.

Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing.

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yeah, sure. So, I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.",positive,0.9993919134,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted I think previously, and as you see coming through the IB fee performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public, and some of that is on our balance sheet and we're very happy to have it there.",positive,0.9982948899,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"To answer your other question, Mike. So, some of the – I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank’s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit – people – we talk about ‘CCAR-ness,’ but there's a lot of ‘CCAR-ness’ from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they’re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.",positive,0.9878960848,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yes, and I would put securitizations in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low- income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk.

But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did in fact add some duration this quarter, with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit, so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes and like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII.",positive,0.9984878302,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yeah, it's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we’d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that – or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help.

On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines, I know we've been here before and markets can giveth and taketh away, but there is a time value in there, meaning corporates and more importantly sponsors need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time?

As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact.

JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2025,Q2,analyst,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the one-time effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was – excuse me, guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some one-time – not one-time items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially – I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?",positive,0.9995377064,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Jeremy can answer this, but this will be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we can not just earn 17% ROTCE and that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17%, you’re a bond. You will trade three times tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so, the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your business, which we are doing. If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers and internationally. And when you look at the midcap business we're doing in Europe, it's been great. Innovation Economy has been great. We're gaining shares in lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the International Private Bank, payment systems. We’re investing in all those things to grow our franchises and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that. That is the best way to use it.",positive,0.9994634986,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yeah. And Gerard, I guess on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable, and I feel like it's kind of all of the above. Let me say what I mean. Like, on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right. Rates are at a good level for us, deal activity is high, capital markets are very strong, consumer credit is excellent, wholesale credit is excellent, wealth management, asset management, essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders, with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse; and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well, and we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about.

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yeah, sure. I mean, it's just normal diversification inside the Markets business. Those businesses are doing great.

JPMorgan,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.",2025,Q2,analyst,"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. I just want to follow-up on Ken's question about sales and trading. And I think you kind of addressed this, Jeremy, but I just – you’ve had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional Q1 on the back of a really strong 2024. I mean, how are you thinking about how much of this really is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable and presumably less volatility, good for investment banking. But do you see – would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result? Or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share? I'm just curious how much – how you think about what's exceptional versus what's more durable here.",positive,0.9992893934,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2025,Q2,banker,"Yeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So, it's pretty broad based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So, I guess, on the one hand you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially. So, I mean, we've gotten, over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues.",positive,0.9980604053,Capital adequacy

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",positive,0.9994996786,Market risk
JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity?",positive,0.9993502498,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",neutral,0.9861277342,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2023,Q3,analyst,"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",neutral,0.7475149035,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of negative half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted-average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere, roughly. We're certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",positive,0.9608918428,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2023,Q3,analyst,"That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?",neutral,0.8566895127,Stress testing
JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,Want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalized next year or later on?,positive,0.9994031191,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out that it’s quite a bit lower than the current run rate.",positive,0.9983043671,Market risk
JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year.

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.

JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",positive,0.9994309545,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",positive,0.9990449548,Credit risk
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing?

JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex, and I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, does Basel III Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?",negative,0.9858961701,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal? So, short answer is we're not going to change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns.",positive,0.997585535,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is, we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that'll be different in Consumer and Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we've surprised ourselves on those points in the past, so we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-destructive, but not necessarily producing much higher returns, if you know what I mean. So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on-time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impacts on the real economy.",positive,0.5412526131,Capital adequacy

The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?",neutral,0.95744735,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.",positive,0.9990981817,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Between QT, if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week, and we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and because markets do well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. But my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming, and where they're coming from, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too when we figure out what to do.",positive,0.4998858869,Market risk
JPMorgan,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that. And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark-to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?",positive,0.9990794659,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.",neutral,0.6610559225,Conduct risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Just the competition, when we look at it, it's Wells, who's coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously Marcus, it's Apple, it's Chime, it's Dave. There are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.",positive,0.9908267856,Operational risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Oh, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data, looking at everything on the internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots so they know to widen the client's coin or something like that. And so, we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of course. That's always been true with technology. And, but, we'll be quite good at it.",positive,0.9969504476,Market risk
JPMorgan,Seaport Global Securities LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of operational risk but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting in market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?",neutral,0.5992115736,Market risk
JPMorgan,Seaport Global Securities LLC,2023,Q3,analyst,"Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets business specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?",positive,0.6687063575,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish. We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.",positive,0.9992753863,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and that's a share gain opportunity for us, but if I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale, getting bigger, especially in markets is quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective, and so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting, but it does seem like the only way out, sometimes, when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in markets over the last 15 years, is a fundamentally very different system, and while obviously...",positive,0.9973149896,Market risk

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q3,banker,"Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",positive,0.9639006853,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,"Truist Securities, Inc.",2024,Q4,analyst,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?",neutral,0.9930227995,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.",positive,0.9970346689,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Very helpful. Thank you.",positive,0.9995773435,Operational risk
JPMorgan,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,2024,Q4,analyst,"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around?",positive,0.700691402,Capital adequacy

The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question again?

We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you.

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of",neutral,0.9881722331,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.",positive,0.9800841808,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Can I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world.",neutral,0.9006356001,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular. Jim Mitchell Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks.",positive,0.9994429946,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2024,Q4,analyst,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",positive,0.9995373487,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",positive,0.9983646274,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2024,Q4,analyst,"And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?",neutral,0.991695106,Capital adequacy

JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee- generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.",positive,0.9985265732,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you.",positive,0.9995417595,Market risk
JPMorgan,"BofA Securities, Inc.",2024,Q4,analyst,"Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.",neutral,0.9873780608,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?",positive,0.8441937566,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability.",negative,0.9561505318,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.

JPMorgan,,2024,Q4,analyst,Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy,neutral,0.99852705,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2024,Q4,analyst,"...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?",positive,0.9995773435,Conduct risk
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",positive,0.9993415475,Market risk
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2024,Q4,analyst,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?",positive,0.9988811612,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorganChase,2024,Q4,banker,"I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people don't want it, doesn't add shareholder value. And I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at life and you have to ""deploy capital"". So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special dividends, they really basically don't work.",negative,0.7831355929,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre- CCAR? And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks.",neutral,0.5896604657,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and, me personally, thrilled to have you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.",positive,0.9993120432,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short-run or the long-run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the order of $20 billion or something like that. And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first, I mean, pay the dividend – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a quarter (sic). I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that could reduce our CET1 too. So, you may see us do things in the short-run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.",positive,0.9656680822,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long- term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.",negative,0.9366468191,Market risk
JPMorgan,Autonomous Research,2024,Q1,analyst,"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct?",negative,0.9880102277,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.",positive,0.9939345717,Liquidity
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2024,Q1,analyst,"Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.",positive,0.9862533212,Conduct risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history.",positive,0.9994972944,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2024,Q1,analyst,"That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for J.P. and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office CRE? Like, how would you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank you.",positive,0.5012306571,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and throwing things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that’s the",positive,0.9928466678,Stress testing
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to have less leases. It will affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really experienced since 2010. So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if, in fact, that happens.",positive,0.9010785818,Market risk
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?",neutral,0.9754838347,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind.",negative,0.9882429242,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...",negative,0.9822471738,Market risk
JPMorgan,Jefferies LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about, we'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with – as it relates to M&A on like go-no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks.",positive,0.9985598922,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor.",positive,0.9994798303,Market risk
JPMorgan,Jefferies LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.",positive,0.9719783068,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?” For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.",positive,0.9995573163,Market risk
JPMorgan,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Hi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages – I can see you put a lot of effort into that, and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or months. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, consumer or wholesale payments. So, I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing? Thanks.",neutral,0.9771545529,Stress testing
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that. If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that’s not only a problem outside of the U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through-the-cycle, that we sort of, we don’t go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage risks, we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is, its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world.

So, there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal recession, with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through-the-cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments, or even certain businesses, that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short-term.",neutral,0.9948732257,Operational risk
JPMorgan,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",2024,Q1,analyst,"Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.",positive,0.9995847344,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.",positive,0.99900949,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up. So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective.",positive,0.998673439,Credit risk
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?",positive,0.887070775,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.",positive,0.9993500113,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?",neutral,0.9973266125,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",positive,0.7944261432,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Portales Partners LLC,2024,Q1,analyst,"As a quick follow-up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question.",neutral,0.9829016924,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q1,banker,"Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.",positive,0.9899308681,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.",positive,0.9995928407,Market risk
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2023,Q2,analyst,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.",positive,0.9736033082,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",positive,0.9988719821,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.",positive,0.9993461967,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Autonomous Research,2023,Q2,analyst,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently.",neutral,0.9957624078,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.",positive,0.9911004901,Market risk
JPMorgan,Autonomous Research,2023,Q2,analyst,"Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?",neutral,0.6233389974,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.",neutral,0.4668833017,Capital adequacy

JPMorgan,Jefferies LLC,2023,Q2,analyst,Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.,neutral,0.9319781065,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from Card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",positive,0.9994588494,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point.

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we are still about the same as we were last quarter.",positive,0.9949099422,Stress testing
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q2,analyst,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as well?",neutral,0.994397521,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.",positive,0.9967734218,Market risk
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2023,Q2,analyst,"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?",positive,0.9987157583,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.",positive,0.9957250357,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome. We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that.

You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you.",neutral,0.9935547709,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix. There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners.

JPMorgan,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,2023,Q2,analyst,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do?

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech.

So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently.

JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2023,Q2,analyst,"Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest.",positive,0.6236260533,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",positive,0.9993444085,Market risk

Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material – what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes?

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually have the proposal yet – so we need those details.

JPMorgan,Evercore ISI,2023,Q2,analyst,"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price.

Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago.

JPMorgan,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",2023,Q2,analyst,"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically.

I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products.

JPMorgan,Portales Partners LLC,2023,Q2,analyst,"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?",negative,0.9910807014,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right?

So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story but that's sort of the business of banking.

And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion.

JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2024,Q2,analyst,"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?",positive,0.9993151426,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",positive,0.7165915966,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",positive,0.8183456659,Market risk
JPMorgan,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc",2024,Q2,analyst,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like?",negative,0.9866381884,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private. And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non- intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB, whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that.",positive,0.9978274703,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc",2024,Q2,analyst,"Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time?

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that. And then, at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor.

And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher.

And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust.

So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front.

So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.",positive,0.990144372,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then, on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case.

JPMorgan,Evercore ISI,2024,Q2,analyst,"No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.",positive,0.6102385521,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",positive,0.9994907379,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",positive,0.9988516569,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII.

But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers.

And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away?

We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like, to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of.

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.",neutral,0.9866663814,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return the capital we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They’re just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It’s just that we don’t feel that now is the right time.",negative,0.9113275409,Capital adequacy

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield- seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises.

And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything?

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.",negative,0.9762593508,Credit risk
JPMorgan,Seaport Global Securities LLC,2024,Q2,analyst,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.",positive,0.9996204376,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q2,banker,"Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.",positive,0.9992745519,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Seaport Global Securities LLC,2024,Q3,analyst,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.",negative,0.9980387092,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",positive,0.9983305335,Capital adequacy

We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that takes bankers and certain technology, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on.

JPMorgan,Wolfe Research LLC,2024,Q3,analyst,"Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?",positive,0.9995799661,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.",negative,0.9936001301,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.",negative,0.9357088208,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.",negative,0.9906822443,Market risk
JPMorgan,UBS Securities LLC,2024,Q3,analyst,"And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?",neutral,0.7384150624,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point.

JPMorgan,Evercore ISI,2024,Q3,analyst,"Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.",positive,0.6241319776,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete.

JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2024,Q3,analyst,"Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?",positive,0.9843972325,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.",neutral,0.9327747226,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"But, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strongly about.",positive,0.9970657229,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2024,Q3,analyst,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is $1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.",neutral,0.9784775972,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital. We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.",positive,0.5642817616,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts. As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick-up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick-up in refi. And our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.",positive,0.9993077517,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open.

JPMorgan,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",2024,Q3,analyst,"And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat quarter-over- quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.",positive,0.9996827841,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no-landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.",positive,0.9988627434,Market risk

JPMorgan,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,2024,Q3,analyst,"Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over-valued, and I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is over-valued and therefore all stocks are over-valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price, and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI.",neutral,0.8336592913,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2024,Q3,analyst,"Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activity?",neutral,0.9524348378,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",positive,0.5914780498,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well-positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity, market-making valuation, buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they are both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always deploy more capital if we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There will be competition both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that, and so far we have.",neutral,0.7877607942,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,2024,Q3,analyst,"Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.",positive,0.9975361824,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my only point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system-wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",positive,0.9988413453,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets. And is it a good policy thing that every time that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1, all of these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.",neutral,0.9749799967,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue.

JPMorgan,"HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.",2024,Q3,analyst,"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.",negative,0.9849725366,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2024,Q3,banker,"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40",positive,0.9769425392,Market risk

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do, in light of the – probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.",negative,0.9719647765,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",positive,0.9987687469,Market risk

I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased?

So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized.

But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.",neutral,0.4158781469,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short- term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",positive,0.9995643497,Market risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company.

JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q4,analyst,"Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts?

JPMorgan,RBC Capital Markets LLC,2023,Q4,analyst,"Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition.

And second, are you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?",positive,0.774958849,Liquidity
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system- wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.",positive,0.9992789626,Market risk
JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2023,Q4,analyst,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM?",positive,0.9987800717,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pick-up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.",positive,0.9992863536,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,2023,Q4,analyst,"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?",positive,0.9989147186,Capital adequacy
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.",negative,0.7817591429,Market risk
JPMorgan,Evercore ISI,2023,Q4,analyst,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?",positive,0.9979248047,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",positive,0.9991214871,Credit risk
JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics.

JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023,Q4,banker,"Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it.

You’ve been very precise in discussing that you would expect to complete the buyback over three months .

HSBC,JP Morgan,2023,Q1,analyst,"Good morning, gents . Thanks very much for taking my questions . Maybe just to follow up on that capital return question, firstly, and then I’ve got another one on asset quality . When we look at your headline capital ratio, it’s very strong and quite a significant tick-up over the last couple of quarters in particular . I guess there  are a few adjusting items in there . Should we exclude the French disposal, let’s say, reversal from the headline ratio ? I guess, if we exclude the share buyback, we get back in your range towards the lower end.  So I guess the question is how much RWA grow th you anticipate the business to require over the next 12 months . Linking to your loan growth outlook as well, I’m just wondering if you could give us some colour on RWA growth expectations there, and that, hopefully, gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can expect. The second one, again related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the year, your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant tick -up in provisions, given your very strong perfo rmance in Q1 . So I guess the question really is, are you guiding us to something specific in terms of the 40 -basis -point provision charge, or is that just an element of conservatism built into your guidance there ?

We’ve seen no nasty surprises. We did do a bit of mark to market on acquisition accounting , but that was evident to us when we did due diligence tha t weekend.  Georges can give you a little bit more detail on that, but fundamentally the asset quality of the SVB book is as we expected it. The team have done a good job in building that business over the past 14 years.  They’ve got good client relations, a good quality book, and good business development potential.  On the back of that we decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have strong technology and life science centres, to take that busin ess model not just to the UK but to take it globally.

Presumably you wouldn’t encourage us to annualise the whole lot, so how much of that do you think is sustainable?

They obviously recently published an announcement that made some critiques, especially around your cost -income ratio and RoTE .

The wealth business – obviously with t he outlook improving in wealth - it is fairly reasonable to assume we will see regained traction and bounce back in particular in Hong Kong, whereas for some of the other activities such as the foreign exchange trading up performance I would caution you no t to annualise this number and just to bake it in as a Q1 outcome, and then for Q2, Q3 we will see how they fare.",positive,0.9993069172,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q1,banker,"On the wealth performance you said most of the non -NII was C MB and GBM.  I think it’s also fair to say that in WPB the wealth busi ness performed well in Q1.  Its revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to Q1 last year.  What Georges is saying is I think we’ve seen a recovery taking place in that wealth revenue.  We’re not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that will continue in Q2, Q3 and Q4, but it’s still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it’s higher than that or lower than that.  We don’t expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3 or Q4, so there should be a level of annualisation on that as well in the WPB non -NII line. With respect to the AGM comment, we said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy.  I think the Q1 results  provide a lot of evidence that that is the fact, that that is the best way.  We guided the market over the last 12 months to a 12%+ RoTE . I did emphasise at the year -end that we should focus on the plus, not the 12, and I think you see in Q1, even excludin g the notable items, we’ve done a RoTE  of 19.3%. I would just draw attention to the fact that in that RoTE  of 19.3% there is a tax credit.  That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter, but even if you adjust for that it’s still a very h ealthy return on tangible equity.  What we’re focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders, and we believe doing what we’ve done is the best way to get improved returns and improved performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action.

HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q1,banker,"So Aman, if I can unpack the non -NII, some of the outperformance that we’ve seen with regards to the funding of the trading book, where we’ve seen $1.4 billion this quarter against $0.1 billion in quarter one last year, because rates were  zero, but against $1.3 billion quarter four.  So somewhat flat – just slightly up from quarter four.  That number, it is fair to annualise it, given current rate forecast consensus.  Equally, as Noel mentioned earlier, the discussion on wealth growth in NNIA , in wealth – the resumption of activity in Hong Kong in particular bodes well for the future, and I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth.  On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the markets activitie s such as foreign exchange trading, which had a record quarter, may not be repeated, and obviously, we may have to look at it quarter by quarter in terms of what business opportunities are there.  And while you can bake in and factor in the results for Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualise that outperformance.  But in general, Aman, if I take a step back, it is a good set of results , and we are confident about the future, and in light of the strong Q1 performance, we will review the guidance  in H1.",positive,0.9994989634,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q1,banker,"Just one comment from me on growth.  I think, clearly, we want to pursue growth, but I think we have the capacity in our dividend pay -out ratio of 50% to pursue growth, and wit h the option of doing buy -backs as well.  Now, at the moment, I think we’ve seen a relatively subdued lending market in corporate banking.  I think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment, and probably isn’t going to  be particularly high in the very near term.  As Georges said earlier, once we get to 2024, one would expect there to be an increase in demand starting to emerge, but the near -term, for the next few months in 2023, given the economic uncertainty, we’ve seen  subdued loan demand.  So I think the message I’d give you, in a 50% pay -out ratio world, we believe the second 50% after we pay the dividends, there is potential to fund both growth and buy -backs, and that’s our plans going forward.  Georges, do you want to  just cover the deposit trend, the inflows, the outflows, and deposit migration?",positive,0.9982688427,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q1,banker,"Sure, Martin.  If I start with some of the outflows that we’re seeing, and then I’ll go into the tailwinds.  Some of the outflows we’re seeing, particularly i n the UK – so obviously UK retail, Q1 is a tax payment period, so there is seasonality here.  We are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the UK, which is obviously draining some of the UK consumers’ savings.  We have, to a lesser extent, competitive pressure as well in the UK. Likewise for corporate s in the UK, Q4 was in year -end where people shore up  their liquidity, whereas in Q1, most of the companies pay dividend s, and then you can see some of the draining liquidity.  We’re also seeing deleveraging of loans - using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side  - especially for those with a strong rate differential between what they’re paying on their loans. This being said, we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit pre position, so if I take Hong Kong and all of Asia, actually, we’re seeing definite deposit growth in the retail and personal banking space.  We have seen 5% growth of our deposit base in Commercial Banking in the US.  So we were one of the beneficiary banks of the deposit migration from medium -sized banks into large banks, and we obviously continued to cherish our propositions and deposits to continue attracting the deposits at the right price.",positive,0.9993427396,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q1,banker,"On loan growth – listen, I think your point’s a fair one . I think if there is a place where I think loan growth could pick up more in the near term, I think it would be Asia.  I think Middle East is another option.  So I think I am being a bit cautious on the near -term loan growth. I think probably it would start  to emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet, trade finance, before people start investing in fixed capital, but I think there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about taking long -term investment decisions in fixed capital.  That is aside from sustainability.  I think there’s a lot of infrastructure spend taking place, and I could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment.  So maybe I am being a bit cautious on loan growth a t the moment.  I think I’d rather be that way in the near term, but I do believe there’s going to be medium -term loan growth, and I think it is fair to say that Asia has the potential to pick up faster than elsewhere in the world.

HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q1,banker,"Just adding to Noel’s comment, Tom, if you look at Hong Kong, in the retail space, both cards and mortgages have been growing in the first quarter.  Even in the UK, we are seeing green shoots in the mo rtgage sector.  I mean, market share in the UK for the first two months of the year is at 15% for new business.  That’s against the book market share for both 7.5%, and the Q4 new business market share of 9%, so we’re certainly there in the retail space wher e we’re seeing growth.  On the wholesale side, I just want to add one comment to Noel’s description, which is also bear in mind the rate differential between mainland China and Hong Kong.  So all those Chinese companies who used to use Hong Kong as a base fo r raising funding internationally will be less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and onshore China rates are that wide.  It is cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in mainland China as opposed to Hong Kong, and that wil l remain the case up until the time we see reversal in that rate trend. If I move to your second question, Tom, we have not shared targets for 2024 as yet, but the few guiding principles, I can share with you.  The first guiding principle, paramount guidin g principle, is that you should expect our focus on cost discipline to continue.  The second guiding principle is that we will continue doing transformation and restructuring as part of our BAU cost base and expect some of those saves  to flow through also i n 2024 and beyond, and case in point is the spend on severance, which we’re planning now to do in Q2 this year, for which the benefit will flow through mostly in 2024.  And thirdly, at this stage, we’re still looking to guide towards a dollar cost number as  opposed to jaws, and the way we would be looking at 2024 as we come to be able to give you additional guidance later in the year.",positive,0.9996241331,Liquidity
HSBC,Autonomous,2023,Q2,analyst,"Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about NII, please – a couple of questions. Firstly, I noted that the NIM was flat in Asia, in HBAP, quarter on quarter. Could you give us a bit more colour around that and what you would expect in Q3? I appreciate the trading book costs have been somewhat allocated there, but I would still have thought that you might see some benefit from higher HIBOR in HBAP. So please elucidate that performance a little bit more. And then, secondly, you also talked about increasing hedging and the structural hedge in order to reduce your downside risk on NII. Can you go into a bit more detail about what you’ve done and how we should think about that in terms of potential benefits going forward into 2024 and beyond? Thank you very much.",positive,0.9988576174,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"Thanks, Manus. So on NIM/NII, NIM in Asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates has translated into an uplift into the non-NII component of the trading book funding, about $0.3 billion uplift in that space. We’ve introduced Banking NII. In due course, we will enhance our disclosure in this space to introduce Banking NII sensitivity and Banking NIM, which would be reflecting such an uplift. With regards your second question, Manus, the hedging activity – so if you look at our NII sensitivity, downwards 100 basis points, it has reduced from $4 billion to $2.6 billion. About a third of that reduction is due to our structural hedging activity and another third of that reduction will be a fact of the change of composition of our balance sheet, and then the last third is numerous other factors including modelling enhancements. If you now look at our structural hedging activity, which we’ve conducted over the last 12 months, the overall impact on the reduction of banking NII sensitivity is to the tune of $1 billion.",positive,0.9971938133,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"Sure, so, due to the somewhat subdued loan growth in Asia, the management of Asia has taken the decision to allocate more funding towards supporting some of the trading activities. So overall funding of our trading books globally, which was heavily used also in Asia, moved from about $108 billion or circa 6% of our deposit base to around $130 billion or about 8% or 9% of our deposit base. That additional lending or that additional transition from funds has moved NII into non-NII income. It is still rates-sensitive and it does benefit from the improved level of rates, particularly in dollars, where it’s coming from.",positive,0.999653697,Liquidity
HSBC,Barclays,2023,Q2,analyst,"Good morning, Noel, good morning, Georges; good morning, Richard. I had two questions, please. So, again, on net interest income, at face value your ‘greater than $35 billion’ NII guide does imply a step-off in the run rate of net interest income in Q3 and Q4. I suspect you’d point us to the ‘greater than $35 billion’, suggesting that there’s some conservatism that’s baked in there, but can you talk to what the pressures are or indeed actually even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to year-end? I think one thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this year, so anything you can give us there. I know, relatedly, that the UK has been very strong as well, so any kind of colour you can give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the UK would be great. The second question was around distributions, specifically around your dividend. You’re reiterating your 50% payout ratio guidance this year. This year and potentially next year does look like it’s going to be quite strong earnings. I guess if I take consensus, looking for an underlying EPS of around 120 cents, which implies an ordinary dividend of 60 cents, that number feels big. It’s big versus the 51 cents you used to do; it’s big versus what you did last year. And I guess the question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now which might then become quite difficult to sustain in the future, as rates come off and earnings taper? Are you bothered that you do 60 cents this year and you do some number that’s lower than that next year or thereafter? Thank you very much.",positive,0.9987145662,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"Sure. Thank you, Aman. In turn addressing your points, first, as you did say, we’re emphasising this as a floor. We’re emphasising this as a guidance of greater than $35 billion. We’re revising this floor because we’re gaining more comfort halfway into the year and with the outcomes of H1. We want to remain cautious, and you may find our guidance to be cautious given the difficulty to forecast some of the challenges I’ll talk about in a second. And then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, look, we are not looking to change the consensus for H2 NII. We’re comfortable where H2 NII stands at this stage. Now, in terms of the pressure and the support we’re seeing, we’re seeing certainly tailwinds that we’ve seen already in Q2, one in terms of additional rate hikes, to be expected very much in the major currencies such as dollars, pounds and euros. We’ve seen also tailwinds in the HIBOR normalisation. We’ve seen about 1% quarter on quarter normalisation of HIBOR and, if you look at July, we continue seeing further normalisation. HIBOR is now around 5%, so probably around the end of July will have fully normalised, and those will provide us certainly some tailwinds as we look into H2. This being said, we continue to see the same headwinds we’ve been calling out from the year- end, and they will continue manifesting in H2. The first headwind which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth, certainly subdued loan growth due to the activity. We have indicated that we may see some resumption in 2024, but for the next half year it will probably remain as a headwind and, naturally, the other headwind that is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs, the behaviour, what pass-through rates we will be feeding in, what is the impact of lagged migration to time deposits. In Hong Kong, we’re still assuming a 1% migration per month, and whether this manifests as it is, it’s very difficult to forecast, hence our cautiousness. Now, if I look forward, look, we’re not guiding for NII in 2024, but there are a few things I can just give you to bake into your analysis. The first one is you have to exclude Canada and France retail on completion of these transactions, which now we expect for Canada in Q1 2024 and in France, as we initially ambitioned, we’re aiming 1 January 2024. The second one – you have to expect that balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in 2024 and that will give us support for NII. The third one is obviously the structured hedging, which I mentioned a bit earlier, and the impact they will have on more stabilisation of outlook for NII. And obviously the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions you are going to use and what pass-through rates you are going to use. And then, last but not least, we’re investing a lot in our non-NII or fee income-earning businesses and do expect fee income-earning businesses to continue driving some of that growth. That’s it for the NII component. So dividends – so what we shared is that we’re going to pay a 50% dividend payout ratio, excluding notable items. I think in your math, based on consensus, you have taken out notable items. I’m not going to comment on the size of the dividend, but what I’m going to say is, in order for us to sustain dividend, there are a few things we’re working on, and you can as well do the math, Aman. The first one is share buybacks. As you know, share buybacks is reducing our share count, and to the extent we ambition to continue on a journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capital-generative, which is what we forecast, you have to adjust your denominator by the share count. The second thing is the NII stabilisation actions we are taking, which should give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle, and the third one is obviously our cost discipline will be maintained even though we haven’t yet – we are not ready to share numbers – we will maintain the discipline, and lastly, as I again indicated, fee income growth and the investments we are putting in fee-generating areas such as investment and wealth are also initiatives to support, mitigate, turn in our earnings and therefore turn and possible in our dividends beyond 2024.",positive,0.9993534684,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"In terms of the buyback, obviously the fact that today we announced a $2 billion buyback will today have an impact on our Q3 CET1 ratio of 25 basis points, but you do expect us to continue generating profitability, which will build capital, 50% of which will be provisioned for dividend, as in based on a 50% dividend payout ratio anticipation, and therefore that buyback will take into the additional capital generation, so I wouldn’t look at Q3 25 basis points as due to the buyback we just announced as a challenge. This is obviously just upfronting, if you want, the profit generation that we will be doing in the quarter. Beyond that, again, at this stage what I can say is we believe we remain capital-generative for the foreseeable future, and as long as we’re capital-generative, we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks, but obviously we will review this on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on a number of factors, including our capital adequacy ratio. I just want to also highlight – and probably answering your question, Raul, and complementing the question of Aman earlier – that the Canada sale expected in Q1 2024 will provide us additional capital. The priority use of the first part of it is for a 21 cents dividend, which we will be in a position to distribute expected in H1 2024, and then the residual part of it we will utilise to supplement or complement or top up any capital buyback we are planning to do.",positive,0.915977478,Capital adequacy
HSBC,JP Morgan,2023,Q2,analyst,"Hi, I have two questions. One is more long term and one is more near term. For the long-term questions, I will ask management if you can give us any colour on potential impact of Basel III reform, because I think one of the key support on share prices is buyback and shareholder return, and then I think the impact of capital because of these potential regulatory changes will have an impact on how we model in future capital return, but this is more in the long-term. I understand that. I just want to get some colour – any colour – particularly after the US regulator released that Basel III endgame. How would that change our present forecast on that? So this is for the long-term question. And then on the near term, just now I think management gave us a number – a potential additional ECL charges on China CRE $0.7 billion, and then I also noticed that for our guidance for full-year credit cost is 40 basis points, but if I look at the first half, it’s a bit less than 30 basis points on an annualised basis, so that additional upside on credit costs – have we included that $0.7 billion or that $0.7 billion is outside of the 40 basis points guidance?",neutral,0.6523538232,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"I think I’ll take the second one first and then ask Georges to cover the more technical, difficult Basel III question. So on the ECL, we decided to maintain guidance at 40 basis points on ECL because there is still a lot of economic uncertainty out there. There’s economic uncertainty around China’s commercial real estate. There’s economic uncertainty generally in the world. We’ve had a good first half performance on ECL, as you say. $1.3 billion is below the run rate of 40 basis points, so we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of that risk that’s inherent in the commercial real estate book in China, but I think I’d be misleading you if everything was so scientifically proven, because it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world. So, I could easily say, ‘Yes, we’ve got capacity to absorb that,’ but it depends what happens elsewhere in the world, but we do believe we have – it’s right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ECLs at 40 basis points, and we have capacity in the second half, relative to the first half performance, to absorb some additional shocks, should they come through from near-term economic issues. Georges, do you want to handle Basel III?",positive,0.9971728325,Stress testing
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"Yes, maybe just finishing on the ECL point, I would caution you not to annualise H1. If you look at Q2 at $0.9 billion as a more normalised level, so that is more a level that you can look at, whereas Q1 was unusually quite low, so this is why H1 will look low to your taste. So on Basel III, the first thing to share about Basel III is we need to know the final rules. At this stage, most of these rules are still in draft form, and they will remain subject to change as we know the final rule. The second thing I will share is that, based on the current draft rules as per our PRA standards for the Group holdings, there will be a minor improvement initially in our RWAs, but as the output floor starts kicking in five years into the journey, so from 2025 plus five years, there is a likelihood that the outputs floor will catch us and that the impact may be in a material up or down – but immaterial up as we look at it this way. This being said, I just want to caution one thing. The US obviously issued their draft rules last week. They came out more severe than we initially expected. They will have an impact on our US operations. It remains a marginal impact. We’re likely talking single-digit RWA uplift against a possible downward move before that, but those rules will impact our local reporting for our US entity – will not change the way we report at the group level, so we will need to navigate both, if you want, in parallel.",positive,0.9987744689,Stress testing
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"Yes, that’s fair. Listen, you’re absolutely right. We’re keeping a strong and tight cost discipline in the bank, but what we’re doing is we’re reallocating cost “from / to”, and what we’re typically reallocating is from what I’d call bad costs – costs that are associated with low returning portfolios, low returning business activities in certain markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitised – so if you look at our cost performance, I think we increased our investment in IT costs by 12% so far this year – first half to first half – we increased some of our investment cost in our global businesses, and we reduced cost elsewhere, and that’s what’s getting us back to the 3%. So we’re investing and saving at the same time, and that is a phenomenon that probably, historically, HSBC has not been great at. It has typically been cost management or cost investment, and it has been a cycle. You manage costs tightly, and then you invest. We’re definitely trying to do both at the same time, and there’s a lot of self-funding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base, and that’s how we’re building out the 1,400 people in mainland China, because we’re saving cost through other country exits, other market exits, reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centres. That’s allowing that investment to take place, and that’s been the journey for the past three years. On SVB, the integration is going well. We’ve had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business. It was profitable the day we bought it. It is still profitable. We’re going through systems migration at the moment. One statistic which is probably an important guide for the future – in the three months post-acquisition, we took in new-to-bank customers at a higher rate than the three months prior to acquisition, so in the transition of ownership from the previous owners to us, we’ve seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with SVB in that first three-month period. That acquisition has also given us the knowledge, the platform, the connections, and frankly, the positive brand and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the US. We recruited a team here in Hong Kong and we’ve recruited a team in Israel. So my view that there is strong growth prospects in that business, not just for the next two or three years – I’m doing this because I think this will be an important business for us in the five to 10 to 15-year timeframe. This is an important sector of the economy and we’re willing to invest in it, so I’m very pleased with how it’s going. We probably do owe you, as an investment community, more detail on how material, what are the numbers, and I’ll think we’ll come back to you at the end of the year with, if you add this all together, the investment and the current bought business, what could that potentially look like going forward and how material is that, but that is something, if it’s okay, we’ll give you more towards the end of this year with the full- year results.",positive,0.9995756745,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"So Guy, maybe I’ll start by talking about the dynamic and I’ll delve into NIM specifically, but first, in terms of passthrough rates on the deposits, for the last 50 basis points of rate hikes from the Bank of England, we’ve passed through to our retail savings rate around 70% so we believe, from a consumer point of view, we are competitive having passed through, and obviously this is a higher than 50% passthrough. The overall book passthrough is in the around between 40% and 50%, but clearly the marginal passthroughs are higher at these high level of rates. Equally on the mortgages, we continue aiming for market share, so we’ve grown the stock market share from 7.7% to 7.8% and our new business market share is now just shy of 10%, so we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages. Now if I go specifically on the NIM, without talking to our peers, some parameters that you can use when you’re doing your assessment and your analysis – the first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loan-to-deposit ratio. The second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance, so that component of our portfolio is single-digit percentage of our retail finance. The third one to take into account is that our structural hedging is relatively young, i.e. we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to be at higher levels, so we have little baggage from structural hedging positions from prior, i.e. when rates were very low, and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our NIM upwards, and we’re not bugged by low-interest-earning assets from older structural hedges. And in terms of expectations, I think it’s fair to expect that the increase we’ve seen in Q1 is unlikely to be repeated as we look into the rest of the year.",positive,0.9993866682,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"So I suppose the way we are looking at mid-teens as – if you look at the first half - we printed a headline rate of 22.4% RoTE. If you take out the two notable items, you get to an 18.5% RoTE. We’re guiding mid-teens to be equivalent, you could say, with the 18 number, not the 22 number, and if you think about 2024, there’ll be a profit on sale of Canada, assuming that transaction completes. There will be a capital policy around that in the form of dividend and in the form of buybacks, but we’re not including that profit on sale within our guidance – we’re not including that in our definition of mid-teens. That’s over and above. So what we’re trying to say we’re giving you a mid-teens RoTE guidance for the core business, not with the big swings in M&A activity achieving it. That’s the way I’d look at it, so we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we mean by mid-teens, and it doesn’t include the big one-offs – either the one-off positives or the one-off negatives. We’re looking at the fundamental business in guiding to that.",neutral,0.9975582361,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"On the non-NII wealth in Asia, you will observe actually the biggest pick-up is in insurance – sorry, first taking the impact of funding the trading book, which is showing under non-NII and is material, it’s $1.2 billion. If you take this one out, the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in Hong Kong. It does appear under non-NII, but not fee income. That growth is a reflection of the growth we’ve seen in Q1. It’s in the 40% to 50% growth year on year. It is reflective of the opening of the border between China and Hong Kong and the additional inflow of mainland Chinese new policies in our Hong Kong business. About 30% of new policies are from mainland Chinese. As you would expect, insurance is a core component of wealth, in particular here in Hong Kong, and that’s the main driver of the growth. We still see some softness in wealth with regards equities trading, and that’s more reflective of the equity markets in general, and I want to say while the Hong Kong GDP is the main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our balance sheet, wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the GDP. It is linked to investor behaviours and it is linked to sentiment in the market. With regards your second question on migration, in HSBC we continue to see a migration of around 1% per month, although it did slow a little bit in April, but that continued a trend that we have been forecasting, whereas in Hang Seng, where the term deposit share is in the mid-30s percent. Our colleagues in Hang Seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate-sensitive deposits, and allowed them, if you want, to accept some attrition against these highly rate-sensitive or rate-chasing deposits, and this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix. They’re benefiting from a very strong liquidity position and a strong deposit franchise, and they do not need, necessarily, highly rate-sensitive deposits at that margin.",positive,0.9982705116,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"In terms of China macro – so, we had a brief conversation before. If you take all of the international banks’ share of the corporate debt market in mainland China, I think all of us together are about 2% market share. So actually, growing your corporate banking business as an international bank, particularly if your strategy is connecting mainland China to the rest of the world in both directions – GDP is not the prime driver of growth in the sense of what you can do, because you’re still relatively niche in the market, and what is a huge market, so you can get growth despite the fact that GDP – and by the way, GDP is still 5%-plus, so it’s not bad, but you can still get growth. Similarly, in our wealth business that we’re pursuing in mainland China we’re pursuing an area which is around about helping internationally-orientated personal customers, and particularly the domestic customers in the Greater Bay Area get access to wealth products and insurance products to help them with their protection needs and their savings needs. That is primarily targeted at the affluent or the emerging affluent sector rather than particularly at the high net worth or ultra high net worth. That is the core business we have here in Hong Kong. The way I look at it is that the wealth proposition here in Hong Kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for HSBC in Hong Kong. Will we see that same opportunity in the Greater Bay Area? The engagement between the Greater Bay Area – or the Guangdong province – and Hong Kong represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us, and what we’re trying to do, which is different to three or four years ago, is we’re targeting international wealth and insurance as our primary proposition, as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in Guangdong province. We see opportunity for growth. Yes, you can’t ignore the macro environment, but we do see conditions for good growth for our business in mainland China.",positive,0.9940319657,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q2,banker,"On the Hong Kong NIM, the NII increased by $0.1 billion but the banking NIM increased by $0.4 billion because the non-NII component of the trading funding increased by $0.3 billion. Now, the way the statutory NIM is computed is only looking at the NII component, and therefore it’s showing flat, but as I mentioned, we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards to the Banking NIM. That will give you move visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding of the trading book. Now, in terms of sensitivity to the USD you’re actually also driving towards the same dynamic in the funding of the trading book. Dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our activities with, so when you look at the NII sensitivity dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies, because that’s a funding currency. Essentially dollars is funding our funding of the trading book, and therefore when you look at the funding book sensitivity we’ve put in a few explanations on the slides where we estimated this to be to the tune of $1.3 billion. It is fair to assume most of it is dollars, and therefore reverses it and renormalises our dollar sensitivity overall on the balance sheet to be that of a negative sensitivity for minus 100 basis points.",positive,0.9995737672,Liquidity
HSBC,Barclays,2023,Q3,analyst,"Two questions , please . Firstly, on costs , can I just probe you a little bit more on exactly what ’s changed around costs ? Because I think as recently as mid - September HS BC were  reiterating their expectations for costs very much in line with the existing guide and the commitment to the cost base . So particularly around the point around compensat ing staff - or potentially compensating st aff - for performance  - I understand th at it’s been a strong year for profit s, but it doesn ’t look like the view of profitability changed materially since you last spoke to us . So that component there would be interesting , and the related point then is to what extent should we expect that element of cost growth to roll over into next year ? At its heart, I ’m trying to get a sense of what the underlying cost growth is that you ’re currently seeing through the business. And then the second question was around margins . I was wondering if you co uld just help us a bit on your experience on deposit beta and term deposit mix, particularly in Hong Kong  but also a comment on the UK would be helpful and, as part of that, what your expectations are for NIM in both of those markets, please ?",positive,0.9992290735,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"So, first, on costs, I think with regards to this 1% cost we contemplate for Q4 , look, we have to put this in the perspective of the financial performance . Obviously , at the start of the year , we weren ’t necessarily reali sing the performance of the group. We obviously need to wait for Q4 both to  assess the financial performance but equally to assess how we continue to deliver on our strategy . It ultimately will be a matter for the Board and the Remuneration Committee to decide , but we felt it appropriate and fair to recogni se that our colleagues have contributed , participated for the last many years through the whole strategic reshaping of the firm, through ensuring we have a great deposit franchise and a strong balance sheet and obviously delivering the growth we ’ve seen in Wealth and Transaction Banking, that we can channel 1% or the equivalent $300 million towards performance -related pay. Again, all this is at the stage of contemplation  and naturally we will reaffirm at the year end, and , again, subject to our Remuneration Committee’s opinion . In terms of next year , now we ’re not giving guidance, but I think we are reflecting in this performance -related pay a year -on-year material change in our performance, as you ’ve seen from our returns and our PBT, obviously with that quantum probably not expect ed for next year. In terms of margins , Aman,  as we indicated , at these levels of rates, mostly in the UK and certainly in a number of western markets  and for our wholesale businesses – at these levels of rates, we were expecting to have materially higher betas than 50% . We’ve expected that additional rate hikes from here would be mostly for the benefit for our customers . If you look at the overall betas  in the UK , overall  beta is just north of 50% . So while the marginal betas have exceeded 50%, the overall number is in the range of 50%. Term deposit mix – Hong Kong kind of same trend as we ’ve seen through the nine month s coming to this quarter, about 1% migration per month . So we have seen 4% over the quarter after 2% previous quarter and 3% in quarter one . That took the total term deposit mix to 31% in Hong Kong . We have not seen a deterioration of the trend . So we expect the trend to remain the same as we look into potential headwinds in the future, but equally we continue to see some of the tailwinds we were calling out before to continue. Just to put in perspective, the UK term deposit mix  is just single -digit percentage points, so it ’s a modest increase in Q3, but it ’s not the main contributor to the dynamic of our NII.",positive,0.9486653805,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"If I could just add a couple of comments on the variable pay , there are two factors that are really coming to play in Q3 . At the half year , when we talked about our cost position, we had an  eye to variable pay , and we had a very strong first six months of the year . There was a lot of economic uncertainty around at that time  – inflation, interest r ates, E CLs, mainland China commercial real estate  – so we didn ’t want to anticipate exactly what the financial performance would be in the final six months of the year . We were confident of mid -teen returns, but we needed to make sure that the final six months traded well . I think as we ’ve gone through Q3 we ’ve continued to trade well . So I think our expectations now on a full -year outturn are probably higher than they would  have been when we started this year and started to build the financial plan for this year. So, in the context of things, we ’ve given an indication that given the strong profit performance , and if it continues into Q4 , it would be right to share some of that  upside in profit compared to original expectations with our colleagues , in t he way that we intend to share the upside in expectations with our shareholders on both dividends and buyback s. A 1% $300 million top up to variable pay  for a level of performance that could well outturn this year is a reasonable amount of additional variable pay  to put in, and I will remind you that variable pay  is not a continuum and a baseline . It is assessed each year on the profit of the bank against targe ts and can go up and can go down. But that ’s a final determination we ’ll make at the end of the year, and we ’re just trying to be fair to our colleagues on what they ’ve done . Trading  performance  has become less uncertain as we’ve got into Q3  – and you ’ve seen the numbers  – and we hope w ill continue in Q4 in a strong manner  and, if that ’s the case, we feel we should reward our colleagues for a very strong performance this year, but that ’s the background to it . Both myself and George  remain absolutely committed  to strong cost discipline.",positive,0.9995778203,Market risk
HSBC,Jefferies,2023,Q3,analyst,"Just following up on costs, how much of the tech and op s cost spend was, if you will, necessary versus discretionary in terms of needing to keep up with competitors and s o forth? Then the other aspect would be on the trading book funding costs.  You have guided to greater than $7 billion for the full year, and on my numbers, you’re already at $6.2 billion, so that implies a material step down in that cost, unless we should  be emphasising on the ‘in excess of ’ $7 billion element there.  Any colour on that front would also be helpful.",positive,0.998773396,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"Purely for the funding costs of th e trading book, you should expect that the trading balances will remain broadly stable at around $130 billion for the quarter.  Then the math s are simple.  It’s just that , times the short rate levels, essentially, in USD.  As you look at the overall Banking NII, I think the indication is that we’ve grown $0.1 billion Q2 to Q3.  We haven’t given indication for Q4.  Again, we feel comfortable with where the consensus is for Q4, and just to reiterate that Banking NII is probably a better measure, because it gets you immunised for some of these choices we make in how much we fund the trading book with. With regards your first question about tech and ops, it’s a mix of necessary and discretionary. We made the decisi on on the basis that, first, when we put our cost base at the start of the year, we had a materially higher inflation in some areas, in some geographies and in some pockets than we anticipated for the year, and we felt that it would be adverse for certain customer outcomes if we needed to take more restrictive action on it, and this is putting it in the context that our nine -month year -to-date reported cost is down 2% year on year, so this is why we were willing to tolerate the continued investment in tech and ops.

HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"So first on the treasury losses, a few things to share here.  The first is we see this as one of the multiple tools we have to manage our structural hedge, and to manage the risk in our balance sheet.  Second, importantly, the losses themselves have been taken already into CET1, mostly last year, so these are already factored in o ur CET1, and this is why, effectively, they have a mild CET1 ratio benefit where we sit today. Then third, as you indicated, Jason, we are looking to retrieve these losses in the NII line, essentially over the next five years, so this is a reinvestment in to either longer dated or higher yielding instruments by faster disposing of lower yielding instruments to allow us to move faster in our structural hedging of the balance sheet.  If you wanted some sense of math s, you could argue if we have taken $600 mill ion losses, it is about $100 million additional NII every year for the next six years or so, which gives you a sense of how we are looking at it, and it’s indeed as part of our structural hedging, which means part of how we are protecting the balance sh eet, mitigating risks of a rate downfall in the future. On your second question  about mainland China, first I can comment on BoCom’s Q2 performance because, as you know, in our numbers we have one quarter delay, so the exercise relates to Q2.  Our value -in-use as of Q3 has room of about $0.4 billion compared to our carrying value.  Impairment is not a management discretionary decision.  There is a rigorous accounting process and we will just follow the process and, based on their Q3 results, we will evaluate those as we go into Q4, and that will be part of our end -of-year assessment. I think the important thing I want to share about BoCom is because it sits in significant investments and because we hold regulatory capital deductions against it, as you can see from the slide on capital, $16 billion capital deduction – it effectively means that any impairment on our holding of BoCom, should i t happen, will have virtually nil CET1 ratio impact, and that’s because any impairment will be compensated like for like by a release of the deductions of a similar amount.  So therefore, no implication on CET1.  It will have an implication on accounting reported profits, but we’ll treat it as a material notable item and it will have no implications, either on the way we calculate our dividend or our dividend payout ratio, so this is why, at this stage, this is not a concern.  We’ll just follow the accounting rules as we do the VIU assessment.",positive,0.9934185743,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"In terms of loan growth, what we’ve observed so far is strong continued growth in mortgages.  We said $11 billion year to date, essentially in Hong Kong and the UK.  That continued even this quarter, despite softness in the housing market, but we remain competitive and we continue to support this business for our customers, so that is definitely there.  We are also seeing some loan growth in the unsecure d space in our retail business.  It will be smaller proportions. In terms of commercial, the reality is the main softness in loan growth in commercial is in Hong Kong, and this is what’s driving the comm ercial overall number.  The softness in Hong Kong has two parameters.  One, the rate differential with mainland China, and as long as we have such a rate differential, it is expected to have mainland Chinese borrowers continue borrowing onshore mainland Chin a rather than borrowing offshore, and that probably will not reverse in the next couple of years.  But also, two is some of the softness we’ve seen in the economic conditions in Hong Kong, which we start to see reversing, and we have been encouraged by the policy measures that have been taken by way of supporting the economy and, as those materialise, we will start seeing some pickup in this segment. Now, outside these softness areas, we do still have strong loan growth potential in growing areas in our geo graphies, such as Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East.  We even had growth in some of the Western economies, so that is happening.  Quite importantly, also, I want to call out growth in trade.  I called it out in the earlier speech, but trade is bucking the trend for the first quarter, where we’ve seen 3% growth in our loan book after several quarters of decline, and that’s encouraging.  We’ll obviously need to see how it evolves, but that’s definitely encouraging, and if you look at it, most of th at growth is in Asia, which means it’s bucking the trend in Asia, and that’s certainly on the backdrop of now the trade between China and ASEAN has exceeded trade between China and Europe or China and the US, and that obviously will benefit, given our foot print in China and ASEAN. On the special dividend, at this stage we’re aiming for completion of Canada sometime in Q1. We will then have to go through due governance and due approvals before we do it.  I think H1 2024 is reasonable to expect, but it is obv iously, at this stage, just a matter of a process we need to go through.  I think that’s what I can say at this stage.  We’ll pay it as soon as we can, that’s what we can say at this stage.",positive,0.9995642304,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"Let me unpack.  There are  quite a number of considerations here.  The first one is I, as always, will encourage you to look at Banking NII, because that will – first, it’s a better reflection of our rate -sensitive earnings, and second, it will immunise you from some of the business  choices we make by putting more funding to support the trading activities or not, and that can create noise in NII versus funding of the trading book, which is unrelated when you look at it from a Banking NII perspective. Now talking a little bit on Q3, before I talk about the outlook, on the Q3 numbers, if you look at Banking NII in Hong Kong, it was up 10%.  Now, this is not reflected in NIM.  NIM is up two basis points, but essentially, because a lot of that upside went into the funding of the trading bo ok, but the full rate -sensitive earnings in Asia, in our Asian entity, has grown 10% by about $0.3 billion.  So that’s the first thing to observe.  If you look at HIBOR rates Q2 to Q3, obviously they were up 75 basis points.  When we look at Q4 to date, there  is another something like 50 basis points baked in the average, so there is additional tailwind into Q4 from HIBOR, which we’ll obviously need to see how the next two months fare before we evaluate. If you look at the UK, the UK NIM was up 16 basis poin ts Q1 to Q2, down eight basis points Q2 to Q3.  The first thing I want to say is this is definitely not the trend here to be read.  I think NIM is broadly stable from here for the next few quarters.  Some of these moves are idiosyncrasies in our Market s Treasury management, not necessarily drivers of trends, so we are looking at it, in the whole, as broadly stable.  Obviously, it continued facing pressure on deposit cost s, but as I just said earlier, at these rates any additional rate hikes are expected to be passed through to customers, and this is what’s been happening, so we’ve benefited from a 75 basis point rate hike in pounds between Q2 and Q3, most of which has gone either to customers in the form of passthroughs, some term deposit migration , in the U K minimal, but some, and then obviously asset margin compression in the UK. As you look forward, how can I invite you to evaluate forward first?  I’m not giving guidance for 2024.  The only guidance we are doing  in 2024 is the mid -teens RoTE . We will be giv ing more details at the year end, but if you want some indicators of how to think about it, first think about it as we will continue facing the usual headwinds of margin compression, but that probably is easing now, having seen most of that compression in Q2 and Q3.  We will continue to see pressure on deposits.  Migration may continue.  We’ve seen a pace of 1% per month in Hong Kong, steady for the last nine months.  That is likely to continue, so these will be the main headwinds. The tailwinds would be the a dditional rate upside in Hong Kong from HIBOR – probably no further rate upside in the major other currencies.  The tailwinds will be reinvestments of maturing structural hedges that have been put at lower rates and, as they mature, we reinvest them in higher rates and that will give us additional tailwinds.  Then the main tailwind, which we anticipate at some stage in 2024, but not yet – at least not for the next couple of quarters, but at some stage in 2024 – is volume growth.  When we start seeing volume gr owth, we will see the support for the NII in the medium term.  As we have always indicated, mid -single -digit percentage point growth for balance sheet is our medium -term aspiration, and as and when this starts, after the next couple of quarters of transitio n, this will give us the additional tailwinds. I suppose that’s probably as much as we can say at this stage.",positive,0.9996225834,Liquidity
HSBC,KBW,2023,Q3,analyst,"Just a couple of follow -ups – the first one is on your hedge strategy, because in the disposal losses, you’ve essentially broug ht forward some of the rolling of the hedge, which we haven’t really seen so much, especially in UK banks.  They tend to use it as a pure smoothing mechanism, to let the lower rates run off and then reinvesting, but you seem to have brought forward that.  So the question is: does that suggest that you’re not just using the hedge as a smoothing mechanism, but it’s to more actively trade it?  Is that fair?  That’s the first question. The second question is really for Noel.  I saw on Bloomberg that you made a comm ent that you feel like the China CRE situation has bottomed out.  Acknowledging that the Chinese government has taken steps to support the sector, but the news flow still seems to be pretty negative.  To the extent that there have been actions taken, they ar e probably not as large as maybe some of the market would have expected or hoped for a few months ago, so it’s probably around tailoring  deposit  requirements in some of the tier one cities.  What gives you the confidence that we have bottomed out?",positive,0.9899640679,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"I’ll take the first question and I’ll invite Noel  to comment on your second one.  The hedge strategy – first, we have a number of tools at our disposal.  We will use them as effectively and as opportunistically as we can to achieve what we want to achieve, which is 1) reducing the downside sensitivity of our balance sheet to a reduction in rates, and 2) extending that reduction of downside as far out in time as possible.  This strategy that we’ve used, which is disposing of existing low -earning posit ions, is one of these measures.  So number one, to remind you, it does not have a CET1 impact.  At least the loss does not have a CET1 impact, because the loss has been taken capital mostly in 2022 already, so that gives us this flexibility on our capital. The second one is, yes, part of the hedge considerations is indeed allowing us to extend higher yields for longer rather than retain some of the lower yielding assets for longer than we wish for and give us additional protection, and the third is it’s als o risk management considerations. We also look at how we use our RWAs and treasury portfolio and how we can optimise the utilisation thereof, and how we use combination of bonds and swap hedges and fair value accounting relationships, etc.  So there are all sorts of number of other considerations which we look at, but the outcome of which, for the purposes of our bottom line, is indeed giving us this runway. Now I need to point out we have done an exercise in Q3.  We indicate that we intend to do another exercise to the tune of about $0.4 billion in Q4, but we do not look at this as a recurring activity.  This is by exception, occasional, when risk management and performance justify it, we will do it.  This is not meant to be a recurrent , quarter -on-quarter activity.  I just want to be clear about that.  We’ve done it last quarter; we’ll do it next quarter.  Anything beyond that we will give you indication, but it’ll be on a case by case and occasional basis.",positive,0.9464208484,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"On China CRE, my co mments this morning were really about the massive policy correction that has taken place over the last 18 months in commercial real estate in China.  It has really impacted very heavily the real estate market.  Do I think that big negative correction in the market has been delivered and do I expect further negative correction?  No. I think what we’re now into is the workout phase of that policy correction.  Equally, I think I said this morning I don’t see a big swing back into positive policy territory for comm ercial real estate.  I see it as fine-tuning from this low base. So what I’m talking about is the market as a whole – the commercial real estate market in China – a massive correction down.  I think we’re at the bottom of that correction phase and we’re no w in a gradual reclimb back out, with possible policy tweaks taking place, but as you quite rightly say, they’re not going to be big swings back up in policy correction.  They’re going to be smaller policy correction s taking place, as we’ve seen in recent w eeks. Now what does that mean for ECLs for banks, both domestically and internationally?  Those ECLs have and could still emerge over time, but I think the market itself has bottomed, and now we’re in a period of readjustment for the new norm, and I don’t  see a big readjustment back up.  From our point of view on ECLs, I think we feel, as Georges has said, we’ve got good coverage ratios on the unsecured book – the 50% of our offshore book that is SOE -related or POE -related.  We do not see that same policy co rrection affecting the SOEs the way it’s affected the POEs, so we don’t see necessarily a downside on that at this stage, and on those POEs in that 50% I talked about, those POEs are largely either secured or they’re not in the residential sector.  They’re in CRE and other forms of the sector. So from our point of view, we feel well -provisioned at this stage.  It’s not to say that there aren’t potential problems on the horizon from an ECL point of view for the industry, but we feel as though we’re well -positioned.  I suppose my comment was on the market as a whole, in that there’s been such a massive correction.  I think we’re now in a gradual rebuild, but that gradual rebuild will take time and there will be the potential for the industry to bear some further  losses, and we are keeping a close eye on that and what it means for us, but we think we’re well - provisioned at the Q3 level.  We’re probably going to take some more of our plausible downside scenario in Q4, but as Georges said earlier, we think that we’ve  got the capacity within our overall guidance on ECL of 40 basis points to absorb any further charges we may or may not take in Q4.",positive,0.7688474059,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"On your first point, this is a matter of phasing it in time so that we’re doing it thoughtfully, carefully, we’re evaluating the impact every time we do an activity , so we didn’t put a cut -off, per se, for Q3 and Q4.  As you can see , the numbers don’t follow a given symmetry.  It’s just a matter of where we are on the journey when we cut off the books on 30 September , but we carry this activity throughout , and we look for the right market opportunities to do it.  I think this is the way we look at it. With regards to your second point, a couple of things I can share  here.  The first one is the rate sensitivity of China.  So, just to give you an indication, the impact of the China NIM on our HBAP, or our Asia NIM, is about three basis points , so the fact that we have some rate compression in China , simply because of the  policy rates compression  – this has affected our overall Asia NIM by a couple of basis points.  That’s the quantum or the magnitude given , obviously , the size and scale we have in Hong Kong versus the size and scale we have in mainland China and other geog raphies. The second one to call ou t is that the rate differential  – we expect it to remain for a matter of many quarters, probably a couple of years, which does mean that mainland Chinese customers borrowing offshore in Hong Kong will probably remain subd ued for the next couple of years because it’s much cheaper for them to borrow at lower rates in RMB , and  this headwind is likely to continue for the next couple of years. Now, on the flipside, again because of the rate differential, the growth in wealth t hat we observe in Hong Kong is obviously a positive and a beneficiary of the rate differential , so the fact that we’re seeing more wealth build -up in Hong Kong, the fact that we’re seeing more demand for our insurance products and capabilities in Hong Kong , also reflects the fact that , for mainland Chinese, for some of them and subject to the quotas they’re allowed to do, etc, it is interesting. It’s an attractive proposition to invest offshore because they’re getting great pickup.  So we’re seeing the benef its of that when we talk about our insurance business in Hong Kong and our new business CSM, while we’re seeing the challenge on the other side. Look, all this , at the end , to say is we remain very optimistic in the medium to long  term on both Hong Kong a nd mainland China, and we just need to see some of the short -term difficulties play out specifically in mainland China, specifically in the real estate sector, until we recover and are able to see some of the momentum back on positive growth there.",neutral,0.8290058374,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q3,banker,"Just a quick one, firstly  – you’ve reiterated the greater than $35 billion NII guidance.  In the past, you’ve talked about being comfortable with consensus, which is obviously above that, $36.5 billion , so if I could just push you as to  whether you are still comfortable with the consensus. And t hen, second question  – buybacks and how you’re thinking about those.  Obviously , a step change today going from $2 billion to $3 billion for the next quarter.  Pro forma, for the buybacks and for France retail, you’re looking at a 14.2 % CET1 ratio, still within your target range.  You’ve said 2024 RoTE  similar to 2023, payout ratio for the dividend similar to 2023 , so the only delta seems to be loan growth, where you’re still talking cautious short  term but aiming for mid -single digits in medium  term. So, when we’re thinking about the buyback going forward, is it a trade -off with that loan growth? Is it a case of , if the loan growth goes to mid -single digits, you go back to $2 billion, whereas if it stays low single digit , you stay at $3 billion ?

As you look into 2024, we haven’t given guidance yet, apart from the mid -teens RoTE , but I ’d like to just point out two things just to keep in mind.  The first one is, again, Banking NII would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates , so look at NII in combination with the funding cost s of the trading book and immunise, there fore, your analysis from how much we end up channelling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities. And then,  the second one, just to keep in mind, is the disposal of Canada and France, which will both contribute to an annualised $1.5 bill ion of NII , which will obviously not be there when the sale is complete.  And finally, balance sheet growth at some stage in 2024, where we start resuming the expectation for our balance sheet to grow.  That in the broad sense , is how we should look at for 2 024.

HSBC,a couple of things,2023,Q3,analyst,"first, the reason we announced a $3 billion buyback  – certainly because we have the capital to support it, but equally , because we have an extended period to do it.  We mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to February results.  That gives us four months.  So I’ll definitely encourage you not to look at $3 billion as the new $2 billion ; it is not. It is a reflection of the fact that we’re aiming for – well, we have a longer period ahead of us, four months instead of three, and we’re aiming to see if we can get up to $3 billion during that period.  It’s the refore a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback. Look, I continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks, as long as  the capital supports it.  We look at our forecast , and our capital build up  does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast, and therefore , it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks.",positive,0.8454540968,Capital adequacy
HSBC,a couple of things,2023,Q3,analyst,"first, as you know, t he proceeds of the sale of Canada will give us a buyback runway regardless of loan growth because the proceeds less the priority use for special dividend will still allow for a few billion dollars of additional buyback , and i rrespective of our loans , so that will give us runway for loan growth. Second, I just need to also highlight, when we talk about mid -single -digit loan growth, we’re not saying mid -single -digit RWA growth.  Some of our loans, specifically in the mortgage space, which is a big component for our loan growth, have lower RWA density , and therefore benefit from lower RWAs, and therefore , our RWA growth is expected to tra il loan growth, absent credit reviews.  And t herefore , we don’t see that there is a competition between loan growth and buyba cks. I think this is a fine balance between the two and an appropriate trade -off between the two. I’ll move straight to the closing remarks.  Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your questions.  I want to end by reiterating that we’ve had a go od nine months.

In terms of bank ing NII sensitivity, we do have a slide at the back end of the deck which I can point you to, which shows for the further 100 basis points and for future years what’s the impact.  What I can point you to is, number one, we continue to intend to increase, su bject to market conditions but as of today , to increase the structural hedge, second the volume of the structural hedge.  Second, we continue to intend to increase the weighted average life of the structur al hedge, having now reached 2.8 years and with the intent to take it to about three years, both of which should give you a sense of how we’re mitigating rate impacts into ’24 an ’25 from the structur al hedging activity. With regards gain on Canada, so $10 billion proceeds, $4 billion will be considered – well, we committed to consider as a priority use for a special dividend.  The residual $6 billion will constitute about 0.8% or 0.9% additional CET1, which very likely will be at the Q1 outcome. We will continue looking at opportunities, but it remains our intent, subject to market conditions, our capital position, regulatory position, it remains our intent to continue a rolling series of share buy-backs beyond this one.",positive,0.9995499253,Capital adequacy
HSBC,Citi,2023,Q4,analyst,"Morning from London.  Good afternoon, to yourselves.  Two questions, please.  Firstly, I just want to clarify the messaging on the banking NII outlook.  If I rewind 12 months ago, I think you gave guidance for greate r than $36 billion of reported NII, but then this time a year ago you said you weren’t seeking to move consensus, which at the time was actually higher.  It was at $37 billion.  If I fast forward to today, you’re guiding to greater than $41 billion.  If I loo k at consensus to NII, I adjust the trading book funding costs, it looks like consensus banking NII is around $44 billion.  So are you seeking to rebase consensus banking NII or should we put greater emphasis on your ‘greater than’ within that $41  billion target?  So that’s my first question.  I just want to clarify that messaging. My second question is around the hedge.  Thank you for the extra disclosure on the $478 billion nominal and the 2.8 years average life.  Can you give us an idea of both the average y ield on that book and also what it’s currently rolling off at and what you’re aiming to roll it back on at, if you are extending the duration out?  Thank you,",positive,0.9921466708,Liquidity
HSBC,JP Morgan,2023,Q4,analyst,"I have two questions here.  The first question is I want to clarify the mid -teen RoTE guidance is a normalised RoTE.  That means that the RoTE exclud es Canada disposal gain.  I want to clarify that, because if that is the case in mid -teen RoTE then, if you look at the company comp iled consensus the RoTE is 17.4%.  I just calculated on a very top-down basis you’re excluding the disposal gain and consensus, RoTE is roughly a round mid-teens as well.  The thing is that I think that means the HSBC guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of normalised RoTE, but on NII , on costs , in previous questions I think there may be a bit of reset in expectation s. I think the 5% cost  is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating.  Does that mean that you are quite optimistic on non -NII growth, i.e. fee growth?  Or maybe you have a different view on asset quality, and hence the ECL charges. This is the first part of the big question. The second part is on BoCom.  May I know what triggered the $3 billion impairment charges ? As China’s yield is declining – they just announced 25 basis point on five -year LPR cuts and all those – should we be expecting more impairments on the BoC om investment?  Basically I want to see if there is any one -time event that triggered this impairment, or if it is going to be a normalised part of the business.  I think in the statement you clearly stated that that would have no impact on dividend and shar eholders’ return.  I believe this is related to the $14  billion capital deduction which you have already made on Associates . I think that is primarily BoCom.  Can you explain a bit of that mechanism?  I think today’s share price reaction is partly factoring i n the kind of concern that there is an ongoing impairment on BoCom that will affect the company’s ability to deliver shareholders’ return.",positive,0.9992523789,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"Katherine, taking them in the order you said, first, the mid -teens RoTE is excluding notable items , therefore it is excluding the gain on Canada.  Your calculation is correct.  In terms of NII and cost, a couple of things to share.  We recognise the cost assessment. In terms of banking NII, we have given the guidance here.  I mentioned it in my earlier spe ech, but I will just point you that our banking NII sensitivity has reduced by more than half from the full-year 2022 due to, among other parameters, our structur al hedging activity, so therefore the rate impact on our banking NII is reduced commensurately . Equally, we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start decreasing , which is now planned for H2, and this is why we have some positive outlook for H2.  If rates decrease, volume could pick up, subject to economic conditions, etc, b ut that’s the assessment we have made today. Thirdly, on the non -rate-sensitive earnings, I’ve called out Transaction Banking and Wealth earlier.  Between them they constitute about 80% of our non -rate-sensitive earnings.  One has grown 5%, 2022 to 2023, an d the other one has grown 7%, and therefore we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth.  I didn’t talk about the residual 20%, but in the residual 20% , capital market activities, for instance, is included.  Again, in a different ra te environment we have grounds to believe this can also pick up.  So yes, we are comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue. Can I point you on one thing about cost s? We called it out.  5% for 2024 has a flow -through impact from inflation in 2023.  2023 experienced high inflation.  There’s some flow through, some adjustments, including wage inflation, which we anticipate to do in 2024.  Based on current outlook of inflation that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond 2024.  Without giving you any guidance for 2025, the inflationary component flow through into 2025 does look like easing from where we stand today, looking at 2024 outlook for inflation. If I move on to your second question about BoCom, this is a – we do talk about the value -in- use model.  It’s following the Hong Kong accounting standards, international accounting standards.  Without boring you with the accounting details, the AR&A has many pages, which we can point you to, that explain it.  It feeds into parameters all essentially in  the public domain, including macro data, other factors, including analysts’ comments.  It feeds in through the model.  The model is not highly intuitive, but the outcome is the outcome and we’ve been consistently applying it for umpteen quarters now, and th erefore w ill apply for Q4.  It is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in Q1.  We will take into account the information we receive over the course of Q1, and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome. Finally, capital deduction.  I think this is a very important point.  Your math, Katherine , is correct. There is about $14 billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions, because they sit above our threshold.  Therefore, you could legitimately ass ume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial holdings, BoCom being one of them.  The other one is insurance.  That’s the two, essentially, and therefore you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate, given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage.",positive,0.9995355606,Capital adequacy
HSBC,Jefferies,2023,Q4,analyst,"Just cutting to the chase on some of the questions that have come through on the NII guide, I think you ca n probably get a sense that there’s some reasonable confusion about what the message is for the 2024 baseline.  If we work back from your clean mid -teens RoTE you’ve given us some guidance on cost, you’ve given us some guidance on credit.  It’s getting into a baseline revenue number of about $64 billion.  I think consensus is $63.5 billion or thereabouts.  Are you comfortable with that consensus number? Are you seeking to change that with this guide?  That is question number one. Question number two is why the focus on banking NII versus total NII?  Because there’s going to be, as rates come down, a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic. Indeed, if I look at your annual report you’ve actually got a benefit coming through in the USD bucket f rom rates falling in terms of the aggregate NII.  Why are you trying to distinguish between those two conceptually for us?  Again, it’s creating a fair amount of confusion with investors.",positive,0.5779289603,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"Yes, so I recognise your arithmetic,  Yes, I agree w ith your arithmetic. This being said, I cannot give you guidance on total revenue, otherwise I’ll be giving you guidance on our full profitability, but we recognise your arithmetic.  A couple of things just to highlight for your consideration.  The first one  is our guidance for banking NII is not $41 billion, it’s at least $41 billion, factoring in elements of uncertainty that I called out earlier.  That’s for full-year 2024. You do have the building blocks for cost and for ECL, and then the residual part, if you want, of our earnings story is the non -NII component excluding the gains from Canada.  As I said earlier, about 80% of it is generated from Transaction Banking and Wealth , both of which do have momentum, both of which are areas where we continu e investing, both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing, and in terms of net new invested assets.  We are excited about the potential of these two businesses, and we believe our mid -teens RoTE is not based on unreasonable growth in these areas, it’s based on momentum growth in these areas. Maybe I can point you to our net new invested assets, $84 billion for the year, up from $80 billion last year, up from $64 billion the year before.  Clearly we’re acquiring new assets, but equally,  as you’ve seen, Asset Management and Private Banking grew double -digit percentage points.  That’s also partly due to the valuation.  Our AUM is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving, which is therefore a generator of fees commensurat ely, subject to market conditions as we go forward. Just on your second point, so we’re guiding we would like to move to banking NII guidance. We recognised last year we have moved from NII into a dual guidance of NII and funding costs of the trading book . We think it is much simpler to look at our overall rate -sensitive earnings through a banking NII lens.  The shift from one to the other – which is a zero -sum game, so it moves from one to the other – is reflective of business decisions as regards how much  of our funding we would want to give to the trading book based on various parameters, including opportunities in the trading book, as well as opportunities for loan growth.  We think that it would be too noisy if we have to really manage both on a separate  basis.",positive,0.8910419345,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"The cost of risk of 40 basis points encapsulates everything we currently foresee in our balance sheet.  We have not communicated a furt her plausible downside on the China commercial real estate portfolio booked in Hong Kong, because we believe at this stage that, number one, we’re well provisioned for this portfolio after the provisioning that’s taken place last year.  Number two, we also have less concerns going forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio.  I can point you to our exposure is now at $6.2 billion.  That’s down $3.1 billion from full -year 2022, so therefore we have a reduced level of concern.  I can walk you through, if needed, how our ECL positioning is in this portfolio, but we’re comfortable, and no additional concerns than we called out last year. On the long growth, yes, our expectation is that as economic conditions continue improving and the interest rate environm ent becomes more supportive we would expect to see loan growth.  We continue to guide on a medium term basis to mid -single digit percentage points, loan growth and balance sheet growth.  It’s very difficult to forecast what H2 will look like, but that is par t of our projections.",positive,0.9910262227,Credit risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"Robert, we’ve added north of $80 billion to our hedge this year in terms of bond notional, a little bit more in terms of other derivative notional, and that’s on top of an $80 billion we’v e added over Q4 and starting in Q3 in 2022.  That should give you an idea of also what is the quantum we could reasonably do in 2024 if the market conditions remain supportive for the hedge. In terms of duration, the obvious one to call out is we can certa inly hedge on our weighted average life for slightly longer currencies such as the pound, the US dollar, and to some extent the euro.  We have an inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape – and this is due to structural market – our Hong Kong dolla r exposure.  Our Hong Kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower, and therefore our exposure in Hong Kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies. In terms of Canada sale, you could expect in Q1, subj ect to completion – which is now planned to be on track to be by the end of Q1 – you would expect to see a jump of 1.2%, 1.3% in our CET1 ratio.  The special dividend, which we’re committed to consider, would happen afterwards.  Our best estimate is H1, but frankly, afterwards as soon as we can, subject to all necessary approvals.  That will drop the CET1 by about 0.5, with a resulting net of around 0.8 in our CET1 after the dividend.  We will update you at the Q1 results about the special dividend considerations.",positive,0.999478519,Capital adequacy
HSBC,KBW,2023,Q4,analyst,"Just a couple.  I guess the first one is costs.  What can you do with costs in a falling rate environment?  Because you’ve talked about management actions; I guess the reason I’m asking is because this year I believe all -in it’s about 7% year -on-year, and of course it includes a lot of one -offs like levies in this quarter and SVB earlier in the year, but on the basis that it crept up from plus 2% year -on-year, which is I think the first slide you talked about, the 2023 guidance, t o the end result being something like 6%, 7%.  I’m just wondering what levers you have in your cost management action pocket to combat costs if revenue were to disappoint?  That’s number one. The second question is I think we all talked a lot about what mig ht happen to revenues in various rate environments.  Also, just thank you for the disclosures on the structural hedge.  I guess stepping back a little bit from that, just a couple of clarifications.  In a falling rate environment, how would you expect things like customer behaviour to respond?  Things like deposit mix shift like in Hong Kong.  I guess the mix shift towards term happened quite a lot faster in Hong Kong versus the UK on the way up, and it’s still ongoing from the disclosures today.  If rates  were to turn, would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick, we’re still in a pretty high rate environment, or do you still expect the mix shift to continue? I think you talked about things like capital markets might outperform in a falling rate environment.  I guess, on an underlying basis, just how do you see that?  Because capital markets and loan growth, etc, I guess a lot of it’s also to do with the underlying GDP as well, and there’s still a lot of uncertainty on the horizon.  So, even if rates we re to come down, just how quickly do you think these benefits can come through?",positive,0.9994838238,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"So, on the reporte d basis, 2023 to 2022, we were down 1%.  The growth against our target of 6% also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs we’ve taken in 2022 did not repeat.  We’ve guided how the costs have increased from our initial 3%, where we inc luded severance, into the 6%.  Obviously the last percent this quarter was unexpected.  The rules for the FDIC special assessment came in November.  The earlier draft rules we’ve seen in September indicated we would be incurring that cost in 2024 and 2025, bu t the rules that came in November had a different accounting treatment and accelerated all that, as did all other banks who were subject to the FDIC special assessment.  I just want to call it out that this one was a particular event we called out. As we look going forward for 2024, we’re looking at a 5% on the target basis growth.  This is excluding the cost reduction we will get from exiting the French retail business and the Canada business.  Between the two of them we will be exiting on an annual basis a n equivalent of $1 billion, just shy of that, which is around 3%.  That would be a reduction in cost of 3%, but that is excluded from the way we’re managing our target basis. Just explaining how we’re coming up with this cost – and then Noel can talk you t hrough the levers to manage our cost s – first there is this flow -through inflation from 2023.  There is some wage adjustments we need to take into account for 2024 based on the flow -through inflation from 2023.  That component, we feel, is easing, and hopefu lly in the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of 2024 into the future.  There is continued spend in technology and continued investment in some of the growth areas, organic growth areas.  That’s particularly true in Wealth . That spending is partly o ffset by a number of cost management actions, some of which we have taken already such as the severance programme, which will have a flow -through benefit into 2024, and other actions we’re planning to take. Just before Noel talks to levers, we’re looking at cost as in growth on the target basis in dollar numbers.  We’re not looking at our cost s on a cost efficiency ratio basis.  There may be fluctuation s to our revenue, but frankly in a year like 2023 our CER has dropped from 65% in 2022 to 48%, so we will t olerate some volatility on the CER , as long as we’re managing our cost in a spend dollar basis.",positive,0.9813630581,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"I know this is an important topic.  Let me reiterate up front that we remain committed to cost discipline.  The question is, how are we achieving cost discipline?  We obviously look for efficiencies in the existing organisation.  We invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs, and we’re continuing to do that.  We invest in simplification of the portfolio, closing down busines ses organically, exiting costs organically, but we’re also exiting costs through M&A, and in our target basis we adjust for that.  I don’t want you to lose sight. We’ll be exiting $1  billion of cost in 2024 as a function of M&A decisions; portfolio choices  made for good, strategic reasons.  $300  million of that was the exit of our French retail business.  It’s a business that was losing money, so we’ve exited $300  million of cost by selling and it’s going to be profit accretive, because that business was a lo ss-making business.  We’ve exited $800  million of cost in Canada through selling – we hope to by the end of Q1.  Not tempting fate. Why are we doing it?  Because that business in our hands was probably valued at around one-times book and we were able to gener ate two -and-a-half-times book, over two -and-a half - times book.  We sold it because it was worth more to somebody else than to us and we’re redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders, because we thought it was the right answer for our shareholde rs. We do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generated cost efficiency for good, strategic reasons and we’ll continue to pull those levers. The other thing is we do believe an organisation like us, with the growth opportunities we have, we should invest and we made a decision last year, on our original cost target of 3%, to actually move it up to 4% because we were continuing to invest in tech.  Tech today, as proportion  of our overall cost base, is now around 22%.  When I took over four yea rs ago, tech as a percentage of our cost base was 16%.  We’re trying to remain disciplined on cost s and change the nature of the cost s to be a much more strategic cost component in driving future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies. That’s the thinking we have.  You have our absolute commitment, both myself and Georges, and the management teams, we will keep cost discipline.  We’ll invest and save at the same time.  We have to acknowledge the flow through of inflation, but the other compone nt we made a decision on in 2023, given the very, very strong performance the business had, we thought it was right to go from 4% to 5% by topping up the variable pay pool by an extra percent.  We thought that was the right decision for our people, so we th ink it’s the right cost decision , but it has inflated our costs compared to our original target of 3% and I think we had to do the right thing by our people on that. And then the final 1%, taking us to the 6% number you talked about, was unexpected.  When we talked to you in Q3, we didn’t expect that final 1% to come through for FDIC and bank levies. The FDIC was probably a timing issue.  It was going to come through in ’24 or ’25, but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year.  You’ve got our commitment.  We’ll remain with tight cost discipline. Let us now turn to revenue and let me maybe, again, decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of NII or interest income.  Clearly, the great work that Georges and the team have done on hedging and the further structural hedges we’ve put in place and the extra duration is a mitigant to the downside.  I look at the opportunity on the upside in two components. One is our core USP of international banking.  We have, within our franchi se, clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them, be they personal clients or corporate clients.  We still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate that client base and every time – you saw in the revenue multiplie rs – we take a client to multiple jurisdictions, a revenue multiplier of five times domestic revenue in wholesale banking, three times domestic revenue in retail banking.  That is an internal generated revenue opportunity, not dependent on GDP.  That’s in ou r hands. The second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical and I do believe – I’ve been around 37 years, so I’ve seen some cycles  - and I do believe lower inflation leads to lower interest rates.  Lower interest rates lead  to a pick-up in economic activity, normally with a lag effect, and I do believe that pick up will have a positive impact on capital market s activity in our Global Banking and Markets business.  I think it will have a big and positive impact on demand for c orporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail business – lag effect, as I’ve talked about – and, thirdly, I think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets, and that’s a huge opportunity for our Wealth business. You’ve seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the last three years – $84 billion, $80  billion, $64  billion.  That’s where we’re very focused and a lot of our investment is going. It's for us, the management team, to deliv er on that.  We know we’ve got to deliver on tight costs and cost discipline and we’ve got to deliver on revenue diversification.  My final comment on this is I’m grateful that we’ve had four years of transformation, because we now are through the majority o f that transformation focus – the majority – and we’re now focused on that growth opportunity and we’re in a fortunate position that all of the hard work of the last four years has given us that platform for growth.  Thank you.",positive,0.9726190567,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"Aman, what, historically, we have been giving you is NII sensitivity but, as you know, there is a big component that is rate sensitive in our earnings, which doesn’t sit in NII.  It sits in non -NII under funding cost  of the trading book and what we have been doing – and hopefully that slide was meant to clarify, but I’m assuming now we have to take probably more offline with you to go through it. What we have been doing is showing the sensitivity of both the NII to r ates, as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rates, and then giving you the full sensitivity of banking NII to rates, because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings are to rates and that will take awa y the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much funds we provide the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in -year.  It cleanses that information out, because it’s just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings.  That sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year, in part – at least for 30%, 40% of it – due to our structural hedging activity. With regards the fee income, you mentioned FX having a good and decent income.  A couple of thin gs about GB&M to call out.  First, the PBT of GB&M was more than 20%, 25% higher year-on-year, so clearly a business that increases PBT.  Its return on tangible equity has exceed ed our cost of capital.  It’s something that has been not achieved for many years . It’s above 12% and, to be also fair to GB&M, its return on tangible equity only increased by about 10% because there are some Corporate Centre -related adjustments which have affected them. Otherwise, their return on tangible equity could have followed th e trend of PBT growth because their RWAs were down they could have seen close to 20%, and therefore well above their cost of equity.  We’re comfortable with how the business continues to transform itself, focusing on their strength s and adjusting their foot print, and that momentum continues. In terms of distribution, first it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks as long as our capital supports it, and the outlook for capital does support it, but this remains subject to ongoing mac roeconomic developments and regulatory approvals, etc.  One thing to call out with regards our bolt -on acquisitions is, when we look at an acquisition, obviously the first parameter is making sure it’s a strategic and accelerating growth area that we strate gically want to grow, but the second parameter that we also use equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback.  We’re making sure that, when we go for a bolt -on acquisition, the investment is more accretive than the investment in buying our ow n shares, and this would be a disciplined measure, to make sure we’re doing M&A that is both strategic and accretive. Finally, in terms of other parts of the distribution, around 50% dividend payout ratio for 2024, which we reaffirmed, and then if you wan t to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis, our CET1 ratio, it will be in the 14 to 14.5 % range, which we reiterate, but we recognise we may not need that target, because we may be well above it for a few quarters, in particular than ks to Canada , but also to our own capital generation.",positive,0.9989142418,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2023,Q4,banker,"The pace at which we can get back down to that target is going to be dictated by two things: the capacity of the market to take buybacks and, second, are there alternative uses of that capi tal to support growth?

HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q1,banker,"I’ll start with your first question, Raul.  First, on RWA outlook, of the RWA growth we called on a quarter -on-quarter basis $24 billion.  First, about 40% of it relate to lending and other asset growth, and as you can see from our lending book , we’ve grown our lending book by $5 billion.  There are a number of areas of growth tha t contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion.  Then we’ve had a $5 billion market risk RWA growth; this is due to a pickup in MSS activity against a subdued Q4, and it’s more in line with their activity levels in the first three quarters of the year, if yo u want.  This is the normalisation of Markets activity. And then there is $7 billion which we classified broadly as asset quality.  Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise.  We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis.  We have recognised, across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names which we’ve decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe.  You will not see an equivalent of that downgra de in ECL, and that’s mainly because for many of these customers their balance sheet remains strong, so we’re comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore there is no ECL implication from this downgrade.  But just closing the loop on this RWA downgrad e, you will see some of it materialised in our stage three loans, where we increased our stage three loans by about $2 billion, and that’s exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality. With regards how we look forward, we’re very comfortable where we  are today.  Our credit metrics remain solid.  As I say, the balance sheet s of our customers remain strong for a number of them, for at least the exposure that is collateralised.  We’re very comfortable with the level of collateralisation and the LTV, and the refore we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking.  We will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?",positive,0.9995070696,Credit risk
HSBC,UBS,2024,Q1,analyst,"First of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of your career and private life; I think a well -earned rebalancing.  Georges, I just wondered whet her you’d talk a little bit within the context of ‘higher for longer ’. You’ve referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates, and I just wonder whether – one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forw ard to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue, so I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that’s a material part of the plan and what you think that means for revenue evolution in the next few quarters?  I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn’t see an upgrade to Banking NII guidance this quarter.  I know you don’t rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that ‘higher for longer ’ has on asse t mix and then on credit demand. And then secondly, Wealth was phenomenal in Q1.  I know there’s a part of the business that’s quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now up 20% in a short space of time, but I just wonder wh ether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the net new money flows, or is there an element of market vol atility in there that we should be a little bit careful about?",positive,0.9990929365,Credit risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q1,banker,"Katherine, I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market partic ipants there and the developers.  Firstly, I think the change – the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget – was very well received, and it’s had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sale s. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month; that will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers.  We have to wait and see how that stabilises, because undoubtedly there was an element of catch up  in that first month because people were anticipating some change, therefore there was low activity in the preceding months.  I think we’ve got to see how that stabilises, but I think that is a very positive move.  It will enhance liquidity within the market , it will enhance activity in the mortgage market, but I think it’s too early to call it a trend at the moment.  I think we need to see how Q2 stabilises following those changes, but a very helpful intervention.",positive,0.9996324778,Liquidity
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Andrew, thanks for your questions.  I’ll take the fi rst one.  I’ve got no regrets, Andrew.  Performing this role is an absolute privilege.  You never finish with an institution like this, and that is why Georges is right to comment that you always want to do more.  There are always things you want to improve; t here’s always investment you can do to grow more revenue, to improve customer experience, improve systems and processes.  So, there’s never a notion of finishing; it should always be a notion of continuous improvement and continuous ambition. I think that’s probably the bridge from me to Georges, because I have no regrets about the last five years.  I think we’ve done a lot of good things, and I thank my colleagues for everything they’ve done, but equally you should never be complacent and think the job is finished.  The job of running an organisation as large as ours and with so much opportunity before us to further improve is never finished, and that’s the bridge over to Georges now to take it on to the next level and to continue to execute the strategy.  So, Georges, I hand over to you on both of the next two questions, please.",positive,0.6614834666,Conduct risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Thanks, Noel.  Yes, Andrew.  Just echoing Noel and building on that, we’ve called out some of the key areas of our strategy.  I’ve called out Hong Kong, the UK, the international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by leading transaction banking capabilities, as well as Wealth , all of whic h have demonstrated very strong momentum, certainly over the last few years but definitely over the first half of this year.  We’re confident about the momentum. We’re confident in our ability to continue investing in them, and we’re confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth.  So, it’s just about getting continued pace in the execution of this strategy that has proved its results. On your question about the structural hedge, Andrew, $ 55 billion are expected to mature over the course of the second half at an average yield of 2.8%.  If I try to reverse- engineer your maths , and if you assume the reinvestment happens at around 3.8% with a 1% uplift, then you get $500 million, but remember this is maturities that are happening over the cours e of the half. Therefore, I think you have to average the number, and therefore you have to assume half the number as an in- year 2024 benefit from that structural hedge reinvestment, so say the half of your $0.5 billion you quoted. Also, bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge, subject to market conditions. We have done about $ 25 billion the first half.  It’s a good estimate of the run rate for the second half, and that is a mild headwind because we’re increasing the hedge from higher shor t-term rates into lower longer -term rates due to the inversion of the curve, so you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for 2024 banking NII.",positive,0.9989324212,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Very good.  Thank you, Amit.  If you adjust consensus for 2025 for the impact of the loss from the sale of Argentina, which, by the way, as we communicated, now we expect by the end of the year, therefore it’s more reasonable to assume that the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of $5 billion, which has no impact on capital or on distribution –  it’s fair to assume that impact will happen in 2024, but if you adjust the consensus in 2025, you get to around 14%.  Our definition of mid -teens is broadly around 14% to 16%, so without commenting on the consensus, our mid- teens definition is broadly that 14% to 16% range. On the growing revenue on a sustainable basis, let me point you to three major indicators that are going to be important in the way we look at the future.  The first one is related to banking NII. Banking NII, firstly, has been stabilised partly with the reduction of banking NII sensitivity. If you recall, two years ago we called out $7 billion to be the impact on banking NII or on our revenue for a 100- basis -point drop in interest rates.  That number at the year -end was $3.4 billion, and that number as we reported it now is $2.7 billion, so therefore, through activities of structural hedging, but also through other methodology improvements and balance sheet composition, we have reduced the dependency of our earnings and of our banking NII to the impact of lower rates. The second component, again relating to banking NII, is that, while for a few quarter s we have seen subdued loan growth, in particular in the UK and Hong Kong wholesale markets, we have now seen stabilisation.  It’s early to call it a trend, but we are encouraged by the stabilisation we have observed, and importantly we will be more encouraged to, when we see rates coming off in the support they can have for loan growth, in particular  in these two areas that historically have been a little bit more sluggish – other parts of our activity remained resilient.  Loan growth in south and southeast Asia remained very strong.  Loan growth in the mortgage businesses in the UK and Hong Kong remained very strong, so there is a volume component to banking NII, which we supported, and as you can see from our capital, we have ample capacity to support loan growth. The third component I would call out is the non- banking NII part of our  earnings , Fees and other income, in particular W holesale Transaction Banking and Wealth . You’ve seen the momentum in these businesses.  You’ve seen the continued investment we’v e put in these businesses.  We believe these momentums are sustainable.  There’s an underlying sustainable trend supporting Wealth , in particular in Asia, and there’s an additional support through our own investments, both technology and people relationship management -related, to support growth in this area, and we believe the momentum is sustainable. Those are the broadly three components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future.",positive,0.9990255833,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Amit, just to come to a little bit m ore elaboration on the ‘sluggish’ and ‘subdued’, I’m not surprised that the corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment.  I think it’s right for that to be the case because, in the higher interest -rate environment, not many corporates out there want to borrow at today’s interest rates, and actually they’ve still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet.  They don’t need to borrow, which is a good position to be in, but as you see interest rates come down, I would expect there to be a pick -up in activity. Like Georges just said, we’re starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge.  It’s very early.  It’s too early to call it a trend, but I was pleased that the rate of decline in the corporate lending book in Hong Kong in Q1 reduced dramatically.  It had been declining through 2023, and it actually plateaued in the Q2, and that’s in Hong Kong.  Then in the rest of Asia, we saw a growth in Q1 and Q2, and in the rest of the world we saw growth in Q1 and Q2.  Q1 was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending.  Q2 we saw net growth as well, so I think it’s encouraging early signs as interest rates come off.  I see that happening. The other thing is you’ve also got to remember there’s another side to the Hong Kong market. The deposit market and the investment market is very strong, as you saw in our W ealth businesses.  The net new invested assets going into the business in the first half of this year was about $34 billion, if I remember correctly, and as rates come off, cash moves into invested assets, and I think we’re a beneficiary of that, particularly in Hong Kong, where rate differentials are playing strongly into the investment market, whereas the rate differentials are subduing the demand for loans in the Hong Kong market.  But the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on investments.",positive,0.9987589121,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"It’s a fair observation, and we’re not being conservative for the sake of being conservative.  I think it is too early to call a return to volume growth in the corporate loan market in substantial proport ions.  I think we all expect the rates to come off and cash to move from cash to invested assets.  I think it’s still a bit early in the cycle.  There’s a lot of uncertainty still out there, and given our guidance of mid- teens, which is somewhere between 14% and 16%, is fair at this point in time.  I think that the most important thing we’ve tried to do over the past few years is deliver each quarter and let each quarter be the base for the future, so it’s better to set reasonable and sensible guidance and then  we continue to evidence progress against that as quarter by quarter goes.  I don’t think we’re in the mould, as an institution, of being overly bullish one way or the other, particularly when there’s still quite a bit of uncertainty out there. Georges, is there anything you want to add?",positive,0.9938946366,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"So, Raul, on the hedge size, we haven’t given the specific currency split to balance sheet split, but, yes, you should assume that the sterling component is one of the largest components in terms of the hedge size, and the UK, therefore the sterling component, is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge, but there is obviously still our previous hedges struck at lower yields maturing, and we’re able to benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher y ields.  That was still a component in the UK bank’s NIM, which has been broadly stable , and we expect to remain broadly stable, and the structural hedge reinvestment is playing a role in that. With regards to the rest of the world, it’s a story of two tales.  There’s the reinvestment of old structural hedges at higher yields, and that is a tailwind in our banking NII.  There is also additional hedges we’re doing, where we can, and these additional hedges are suffering from – this is a partial offset as a headwind because they’re suffering from the fact that curves are inverted, but it’s still the right thing to do for the management of our banking NII sensitivity. And then obviously always keep in mind that the Hong Kong dollar exposure we have remains largel y under -hedged, and that’s due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough insurance to be able to invest in the long term to support hedging.  So, the Hong Kong dollar will remain structurally under -hedged in that sense. With regards to the Hong Kong CRE question, so 40% of the book, of the $36 billion you mentioned, is unsecured.  It is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream, including revenue streams from activities not related to real estate.  90% of that book today is rated strong and good, and literally 0% is in the impaired category.  We’re very comfortable over the exposure we have in that book , and we continue, obviously, supporting our customers through the cycle in this space.",positive,0.9994422793,Market risk
HSBC,CICC,2024,Q2,analyst,"Good morning, Noel.  Good morning, Georges.  My first question is on non-interest income.  If my maths is correct, my calculation shows that our adjusted non- interest income is $5.8 billion this quarter compared to $5.3 billion a year ago, and we had $200 million growth on loans.  Transaction banking is relatively stable, so it seems GBM contributed a lot this quarter.  So, I understand that this business has seasonality and is volatile, but do you expect that momentum to continue going forward or do you think the second half of last year is a relatively weak comparison? The second question is a broader one because I realis ed now you speak less about focusing on Asia these days than you used to and emphasising more on the global network.  Yes, sometimes in some ways they do intersect, but I’m wondering do you still focus on exploring some growth opportunities in Asia and Weal th business in the future and do you have a capital distribution hierarchy and preference among dividends, buy -backs and growth? Thank you.",positive,0.9986209869,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Okay, Georges, do you want to take the first one? I’ll give a few comments on the second one and you ta ke the third one on capital distribution.",neutral,0.9990584254,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Very good.  Jeremy, so without giving you quarter -by−quarter specifics in the development of our fees and other income component, the growth that you’ve observed year on year in Q2 were mainly dr iven by two areas.  The first one is Wealth, which is obviously a very strategic area where we continue to invest and exhibited growth.  The other one was from markets, in particular from some of the equity business in markets.  This is coming on the basis of  two components: one, a subdued Q2 last year – so there was a base effect which benefited the outlook for Q2 this year; and then the second one is the fact that we’ve seen more activity and more vigorousness, if you want, in the Asian stock markets, in par ticular the Hong Kong stock market.  We’re encourage by this, and, if the trend continues, this will bode well for additional activity in this space. Let me jump to the third question and then I’ll hand over to Noel to conclude on the second one. Capital distribution hierarchy –  first, we’ve committed to 50% dividend payout ratio for this year, which means half our earnings will be earmarked for the foreseeable dividends.  Part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends; the rest will be meted out at the end of the year.  After that we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business. Loan growth, as we said earlier, started to pick up in certain areas.  We are encouraged – or we have ample capital to support the loan growt h, the appetite we have.  We will look at bolt -on acquisitions or areas that are dead- on strategy but supportive of acceleration of the strategy. That will be part of the utilisation of excess capital, and any excess beyond that we will distribute back to s hareholders through a rolling series of share buy -backs. If you look at our CET1 ratio today, at 15%, and you look at our capital accretion – we remain capital generative in the business based on the guidance we’ve given for this year and next year – we’re confident we will have capacity to deliver on the three.  I will say the buy -backs – we’ll continue looking at it on a quarter -by-quarter basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buy -backs.",positive,0.9995718598,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Thanks, Jeremy, and on your second question, is it an Asian strategy? Is it an international strategy? I think they’re interchangeable.  I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive because, if you look at what we do, at the core of what we’ve done for 158 years , or more is we’ve connecte d entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the world.  That’s what we’ve done from day one of HSBC being founded.  So, we’re essentially about helping businesses and individuals trade internationally, invest internationally. Now, why are they one and the same?  Well, a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are based in Asia; they’re based in the Middle East.  They’re based in the East, and they trade with the West, and the West trades with the East.  Asia and the Middle East are hi gh growth markets.  So, I don’t think it’s an either/or.  I think for us it’s very simple: we’re internationally driven, and Asia is a hugely connected international part of the world and will remain so going forward.  The nature of trade will change, as it h as done for 158 years. So, I think we use the words ‘Asia’ and ‘international’ probably interchangeably and sometimes it gets people confused.  We’re investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation.  There is growth; there is international  connectivity; there is differentiation in Asia and there is in the Middle East, and we have the same here in the UK.  Fundamentally, at the core, we’re an international bank.",neutral,0.997317493,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Aman, thank you.  So, on your first question, look, around $43 billion banking NII for this year is a reasonable expectation, and we’re more confident about it because we’re already seven months into the year, and somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than we’ve experienced over the last few months. Argentina,  we have worked with a planning assumption of $1 billion, so within our around $43 billion we’ve factored in around $1 billion contribution from Argentina.  It is a very difficult -to-predict number; it is a very volatile number; and therefore , the best estimate – you can use around $ 42 billion and add whatever other expectations you may have for Argentina, but we’re sticking with this $1 billion estimate in the uncertainty.  Just for reference, $1 billion was the banking NII contribution of Argentina in 2023, and this is how we’re building the assumpt ion for planning for this year. Now, if you look forward for H2, headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking NII –  the first one to call out is the rates outlook.  We’re using the mid- July curves, which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all the major currencies in the second half.  This is the working assumption.  The second one is on the structural hedge so, as we called out earlier, you should expect a benefit from the $55 billion maturing assets in 2H at 2.8% yields which will be reinvested at higher yields, at the prevailing yields in H2, which will be higher.  You can take a five -year rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be invested at.  But this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on a n inverted curve.  Again, here your best guide is what we’ve done in H1.  $25 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to expect for H2, but it will depend on market conditions in H2. The other components that are playing as headwin ds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth.  Balance sheet growth –  we continue to see strong growth in South and Southeast Asia. We continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the UK and Hong Kong, but we are now encouraged to see stability in t he Hong Kong wholesale book, which has been on a decline for a few quarters.  It’s early to call it a trend, but it is definitely green shoots when we look forward, and it will be supported with rate reductions, the balance sheet growth in this space. And t hen the last one to call out is deposit migration.  That’s particularly true in Hong Kong. Again Q1, Q2 we’ve seen migration at 0% and 1% respectively, which is 1% overall on the half. Just to put it in perspective, this is after full -year 2023 where we’ve seen 12%.  So, again, the trend here is much more encouraging.  We’re very unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year, but it remains a difficult one to predict. Now, as you look forward into the full year 2025, we’re not guiding on banking NII, but a few points for you to bear in mind.  The first one is please remove Argentina’s contribution – again, working assumption $1 billion.  This is following the planned sale of Argentina to take place before the end of the year.  Second, remove the one- quarter contribution from Canada, $0.3 billion, in your NII.  Then we’ve shared that there will be $105 billion of existing structural hedge assets which will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8%, so those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at  higher yield.  So, beyond that you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking NII sensitivity we provided.  $2.7 billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a 100- basis  point drop, and you can apply your balance sheet growth assumption and, again, we believe lower rates will be more supportive of a growth in balance sheet when you look into 2025, but basically all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangi ble equity for 2025 at mid- teens.",positive,0.9991121888,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"So the banking NII sensitivity to a 10% change in pass -through rates remains around $600 million, and this is based off an assumption of around $600 billion of IBCAs.  So, we can work out the maths , if you want, offline.  That number is broadly stable. We’re s till working on an assumption of a 50% pass -through in our banking NII sensitivity. Second, if you look at the cumulative pass -throughs, we’re broadly around 50% from the start of the rate hikes in late 2022 all the way to now, broadly around 50%.  The ear lier part was much lower than 50%; the latter part was much higher than 50%.  It is difficult to predict how pass -throughs will work out on the rate- cut scenario, and this is why I think 50% remains a good estimate of what it could look like, noting that we  don’t have a recent history of that.",positive,0.9972477555,Stress testing
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"Well, firstly, thank you for your comments.  And on your second point on Wealth – I’ll give a very personal comment –  you normally expect Q1 to be the seasonal high and then it to be a bit lower in Q2 and a bit lower.  So actually,  Q2 did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality.  It was a strong quarter.  At the moment I – again, we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say, ‘Don’t base a trend on a quarter or two’, but I think your assessment that actually Q2 was a strong performance is exactly where we are.  It was stronger than probably one would have expected through normal seasonality. I think it is – if I talk to the team, they were confident of a good performance.  They’d seen good lead indicators.  We’ve taken in in excess of $250 billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a half years, and we haven’t seen this period where ‘How will cash move from cash to invested assets as interest rates come off? ’ And therefore,  I think it is difficult to predict a trend.  I think we’ve just got to see it go quarter by quarter, but the lead indicators are good; we’ve invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position. It was all about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it. We invested heavily in the product line- up for our clients to make sure that, if they were going to move into invested assets, they could do so with us rather than another bank.  We invested in distribution.  We had good distribution in Hong Kong, but we didn’t have as good a distribution in other markets,  so we built out distribution in mainland China, in Singapore, in India and in the rest of the world.  So, I think it’s put us in a good position to take advantage of it, but it’s too early to call it a trend.  But your observation is a fair observation for Q2.  It was good, and it’s nice to be able to report that. On performance- related pay and costs, I’ll let Georges cover that, but we’re absolutely committed to the 5%.",positive,0.999397397,Market risk
HSBC,JP Morgan,2024,Q2,analyst,"Hi, good morning.  Thanks for answering my questions.  I have two, both related to capital.  On the capital side, we saw there is $ 6.4 billion of additions to RWAs.  May I know what is that related to? I think in the notes it’s something related to modelling so I would like to know what assumption changes leads to this $ 6.4 billion and is that a one-off or should we see this as an ongoing addition to the RWA? Number two, we noticed some deterioration in asset quality on the Hong Kong CRE book. According to the disclosures, the deterioration seems quite significant as well.  Can you explain to us w hat is the impact on capital? Because we understand that there is limited impact on ECL charges but mainly reflected on capital.  So, what is the drag on capital? And then also, going forward, what is your view on Hong Kong CRE, in particular for the loans which are already in the stage 3 categories? Are you expecting that there will be a recovery of loans through disposal of collateral or are you expecting that the borrowers will eventually make up for the loans? Thank you.",negative,0.5598126054,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"So, first, Wealth income –  the way  we report it essentially is F ees and other income.  So the slide I have there for Wealth – that’s particularly the fees part, which is fees earned on asset under management or for insurance in particular related to new business CSM. So the impact, if you want, on rates is more about the transition of customers from deposits into AUMs.  So this has been happening.  We’re seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring, if you want, to AUMs in our Wealth proposition.  It is likely, on a trend basis, that when rates come down and the earnings you can make on deposits reduces, that customers may shift some of it into AUMs –  it will be visible now in our net new invested assets proposition, and then we will be able to service them in the fee space.  So, yes, there is a component where we do expect more Wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being less remunerative, but this is more on a broad trend basis, not a direct linkage. We are also benefiting from the structural growth of Wealth, in particular in Asia, where we believe the underlying market is growing at very -high-single digit if not double- digit percentages over the next five years, and on top of that underlying growth, which we’re benefiting from.  We are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space.  So, this is definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum. On your second point, it’s a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth, but we have also a strong dependence for our banking NII to deposit growth, which constitutes the underlying for our average interest -earning assets.  So we’ve seen this quarter deposits growing 2%.  I caution you not to annuali se the 2% because some of it is seasonal; some of it is one- off. But we have a fantastic deposit franchise.  You know us. Everywhere we operate, we have a very strong balance sheet that’s very appealing, and we have a very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail, which means that we will continuously look to capture deposits.  We continue winning Global Payment s Solutions mandates in the w holesale space; we continue being attractive for retail customers; and we jus t shared –  Noel shared 345,000 new customers joining our Hong Kong business alone.  In the UK in 2023 we added 1 million new customers.  So therefore,  we do continue seeing a good underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours.",positive,0.9983199239,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q2,banker,"And I think I’d reinforce that and add another comment.  The trick for us in the past – we were very good as a retail bank; we were very good as a corporate bank; but, when customers, whether they were retail customers or corpor ate customers, wanted to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other banks because our product range and our distribution wasn’t strong enough.  We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capabilit y for Wealth so that that cash –  if it did move, it moved within the bank not outside the bank, and one of the byproduct benefits is, if you’ve got a good Wealth proposition, you also attract the cash.  You keep the cash in the bank as well.  They go hand in hand. And so I think –  look, I think we’re in a very different position today in offering Wealth propositions to clients, and what we’ve done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream so it’s less dependent on purely corporate banking and retail banking and there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal capacity, and that’s, I think, the exciting trend for the future, and I think that’s why we believe that we’re well positioned to deliver mid- teens ROTE next year: because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering.  So I just want to say that’s not a by -chance strategy.  That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the bank and the invested assets in the bank.

HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"Andrew, as you know, we’ve been investing in our Wealth capabilities for some time. Wealth was up 32% year on year in the third quarter and 20% year on year for the nine months. That growth was particularly driven in Asia, where we see a favourable operating environment, but we are seeing broad-based growth across the main segments. That’s supported by strong customer growth and growth in net new invested assets. So we have guided previously to high single-digit growth. I think it’s fair that we may well outperform that in the short term.",positive,0.9996970892,Conduct risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"So, on banking NII – thanks for the question, Aman. If I might be forgiven for giving you a longer answer to this, if we start on 2024, we’ve reiterated our guidance on 2024 of banking NII of around $43 billion, but encourage you to think about that as $42 billion ex- Argentina. In total, we’ve printed $31.6 billion for the nine months to date, and we think the Q3 run rate of $10.6 billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about modelling 2025. We don’t provide guidance at this stage on 2025 banking NII guidance, but if you take that clean run rate of the $10.6 billion, which I agree is about $42 billion – we’ll have disposed of Argentina – so therefore we then think of the building blocks for you to model this along four factors. Firstly, rates – the reduction in rates implied in the markets will be clearly a headwind. The cuts during the third quarter – given the timing of them, they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarter’s results, but we’d encourage you to use our banking NII sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that component. We then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind. We’ve got the reinvestment of maturing positions that will enable us to reinvest them at higher rates. We’ve signalled that, for 2025, we’ve got $115 billion maturing at an average yield of about 2.9%, so think about those maturing and being replaced at something along the lines of five-year bond rates. We’ve then got volume growth. Whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in 2024, we do hope that, with interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up, we will see more loan growth. We continue to guide to mid-single digits in the medium-to-long term. The timing of getting there will be unpredictable. And then, lastly, we keep an eye on time deposit migration. That has been relatively stable, particularly in Hong Kong, at 39% over the last couple of quarters, but the impact on that as rates come off will be variable. It depends on competitive pressures and customer behaviour. So all of those factors are how we have thought about it and modelled it and included that within our mid-teens RoTE guidance for 2025.

HSBC,China Securities,2024,Q3,analyst,"Good morning, Georges. Good morning, Jon. Thank you for taking my question. I’ve got one question on transaction banking because we’ve seen a slight recovery in transaction banking income in the third quarter, but I think that’s maybe driven by FX volatility, but maybe we can see more rate cuts going forward and maybe we’re going to see continued FX volatility going forward, so could you please give me a little bit more colour on the future outlook of transaction banking income?

HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"We’ve been pleased by the growth in Wholesale Transaction Banking in the quarter, up 7%. As you say, an element of that is client-driven activity around FX and rates volatility, but within there, we continue to invest in Global Trade Solutions and Global Payments Solutions. On Global Trade Solutions, we continue to grow our market share in both Hong Kong and the UK, and so, as that market comes back, there is the opportunity for that to be a platform for our growth. Similarly, you’ll see us continue to invest in Global Payments Solutions, and we see a very optimistic path for the payment markets going forward.",positive,0.9996936321,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"If I pick up your second point on Hong Kong CRE it’s actually a very similar picture to that we described at Q2. A few customers continue to face cashflow pressures. Some of that is rates resultant, and as rates come off, we would hope that begins to abate some of those cashflow pressures. If you look at the Asia wholesale stage threes, they were up $1.1 billion in the quarter. Some of that relates to Hong Kong CRE. That also drove a modest amount of additional RWAs. For the ECLs on that, we’ve referred to the fact that there was a $100 million charge on ECLs. That was both across stage one and stage two. The stage three ratio is slightly up quarter on quarter, but we continue to see good collateral across that portfolio, so we don’t see this as a material ECL driver going forward.

HSBC,CICC,2024,Q3,analyst,"Good morning, Georges. Good morning, Jon. My first question is on the structural hedge. Georges, you mentioned that $25 billion is a good run rate for you to build up the structural hedge in the second half, but in Q3 that increased by $27 billion, and maybe most of that comes from FX impact. Do you still stick to a $25 billion run rate, or would you like to accelerate it? The second question is I’d like to hear your thoughts on what areas HSBC can further make investments, because it seems like over the years our strategy always emphasised that the bank had to make excellent good cost discipline, and we did it. We made some investments, but mostly small ones. If you look forward, do you see any opportunities that may help to further drive growth and take market share, or do you think it’s better to stay cautious as we are still facing some top-line pressures? Thank you.",positive,0.9995658994,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"Jeremy, if I pick up your question on structural hedge, as you rightly say we have increased our structural hedge during the period from $504 billion at 30 June to $531 billion at 30 September, but that was mostly FX driven. The duration of that remains 2.8 years. We would continue to expect to increase our structural hedge, but that will depend on market conditions that we have. I would say that the big increases of our structural hedge are probably behind us, so further increases from here will only have a modest impact on our banking NII sensitivity.",positive,0.9996366501,Market risk
HSBC,JP Morgan,2024,Q3,analyst,"Thanks, Georges, and thanks, Jon. My questions will be two. The first one I would like to ask is about NII. The confusing thing here is that the headline NII actually slightly misses expectation, but if we work out the banking NII there’s a moderate beat, and also we try to calculate what is the banking net interest margin. It seems it’s by and large stable. Just starting in Q3 HIBOR actually went down on average 50 basis points. May I ask what is driving that stable net interest margin? Will it be from the liabilities management side? Just now Jon gave us some colour in terms of deposit migration, but is it possible to give me some numbers to work around? What is the CASA ratio in Hong Kong and how has the trend changed? This will be my first question. My second question is that, when I look at the RWA migration, on the numerator I saw that in the migration side there is a $2 billion addition to CET1 capital due to movement in reserves. Can we get a bit of colour on that one? Will we be seeing a similar type of movement in the coming quarters? Actually, I have one additional question on the loss that we were talking about, the legacy securities. Can you give us a bit of colour on this one. I understand that management put this into notable items, so supposedly to be one off, but is it really one off in nature? Will we have other securities and perpetual bonds that we would like to redeem in the future? For example, do we have another 10% type of perpetual bond currency in our book that we may be looking to redeem when opportunities arise? Thank you.",positive,0.9642887115,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"Thanks, Katherine. Three questions there. If I start on your net interest margin, we give some detail on the net interest margin on page 17 of the slide deck, but effectively the net interest margin has moved from 162 bps to 146 bps. There’s three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as you’ve mentioned. Two, some Argentina volatility, and then the remaining is on – we’ve allocated more funding to the trading book, and as you know that will be a drag on net interest income but also an equal and opposite benefit on non-net-interest income. Our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking NII lens. There you’ll see that our clean run rate ex Argentina and ex the notables has been relatively stable period on period, reflecting the fact that the Q3 rate cuts, given their timing, had a modest impact on Q3. You’d also asked about deposit migration. We’ve again got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question and then particularly the change in other adjustments for CET1 capital, that is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through OCI. We’ve generated a gain on those, which has given us also a capital benefit on that. I think on legacy securities Georges has covered most of the questions on that, but we’re not signalling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions.

HSBC,KBW,2024,Q3,analyst,"Morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two questions. One was just a clarification. Just to be clear, the $1.1 billion increase in stage three loans in Hong Kong, is that all CRE, just to be clear on that? That was the first question. The second one is we’ve obviously got a US election coming up in the next couple of weeks, and I just wondered if you could give us some thoughts from your perspective in terms of the possible risks and opportunities that you see that could come out of that with the two realistic options. Just related to that, there was a lot of press comment that your reorganisation was driven by splitting up the Asian and the UK or developed markets businesses. Is that actually right, or is that just idle speculation from journalists?",positive,0.9744705558,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2024,Q3,banker,"Let me take your second and third questions and Jon can address the stage three question. Look, this is a matter for the US electorate to choose their president. I’m not going to speculate or comment. We will see the outcomes on 5 November, but what is important for us is that we serve our customers. We have been serving our customers through an evolving set of rules and regulations on the global scale. We serve them for their needs, especially for their cross-border needs, where we’re unique at being able to do so. We obviously comply with all rules and regulations. We will make sure that our customers are able to comply with all rules and regulations, insofar that their financial needs are concerned. Any new rules and regulations which may come with any new administration are things that we will obviously comply with and support our customers to comply with. What I can say, though, is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers’ cross-border needs. This is one of our unique areas of competitive edge and this remains unchanged. Our customer needs remain broad-based and global, and we will continue supporting them on that mission. With regards to the reorganisation, this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation – as has been speculated by some – of splitting the Asia business, etc. Absolutely not. This is a simplification of the bank where we today govern ourselves through five regions, and we’re bringing this regional setup down to two. That is part of the simplification. It is also meant to help us speed up the build-out of what is a very promising corridor between the Middle East and Asia. We’re seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years. Our customers across both the Middle East and Asia are looking for opportunities of trade and investments between them, and we’ve been – we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor. That simplification should also help speed up the build of that corridor. I remind you in our western geographies now we’re essentially a wholesale bank. We have sold our retail banking activities in France. We’ve sold the mass retail activities in the US. We’ve sold the bank in Canada. We’ve sold the bank in Greece. We are in the process of selling the bank in Argentina, and with that we’ll be left with what is essentially a Corporate and Institutional Banking business that also brings some simplification aspects to the way we govern ourselves in this region.

HSBC,RBC,2024,Q4,analyst,"Good morning, both. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on capital, please. In relation to your CET1 ratio guidance of 14% to 14.5%, before today, this used to have a caveat: you’d aim to manage this down further over time. I just note that that hasn’t been mentioned in today’s update. What are your latest thoughts on your medium- term ambitions for the CET1 ratio and has there been any change in sentiment? And then, secondly, on costs in relation to your $1.5 billion of savings, you note that they will be taken to the bottom line, although presumably there’ll be offsets from drivers such as inflation. Maybe you could just clarify directionally what you expect the shape of costs will do coming out of 2025 and going into 2026 and 2027? Thank you.",positive,0.8041125536,Capital adequacy
HSBC,Barclays,2024,Q4,analyst,"Good morning, Pam. Good morning, Georges. I had two questions. I think you’re pointing to much better pre-provision profit outlook than consensus. I guess we’ve laboured the discussion around costs, but my takeaway is that it is broadly flattish beyond 2025, and maybe a bit of growth, but well lower than where the street is. I think Banking NII guidance also speaks for itself, so there are two related questions to that. One is around non-interest income. There’s a lot of moving parts on non-interest income, but I think you’re coming in with significant momentum on non-interest income, in excess of consensus, but we do have a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything you can do to help us? I know you don’t like to talk too much about non-interest income, because there’s volatile line items in it, but you’ve got double-digit growth momentum in wealth management, trade that’s probably growing low to mid-single digits. Who knows what markets do, but they’re probably not going backwards. Then you’ve got a retail piece as well. But it just does feel like that is something that is trending well in excess. So if you were able to comment in respect of 2025 consensus, that would be really helpful. The second is about Banking NII. So the $42 billion guidance this year is great. And I know there’s a lot of focus on lending, but really it’s deposits that matter, right? You alluded to the strength of your franchise. And loans are going to be subdued for a while, but deposits are already growing and, indeed, they’re going to continue growing from here. Can you try and help us with that? Are you able to quantify the deposit growth and average interest-earning asset growth that we might look to expect? Because I think you can comfortably grow your balance sheet despite a subdued demand dynamic in your key markets. I think that would helps underpin the Banking NII beyond 2025. My last question, then, is around FX and if you were to mark to market any of the cost guidance, for example, for the spot FX rate, if that would affect any of your guidance or commentary today, that would be really helpful.

But the key franchise factors are Wealth – it’s a structural growth, and those dynamics will persist . They are driven by our brand .  They’re driven by the range of products we have to offer, the improvements we’ve made in terms of technology, and that investment is going to pay .  And as Georges said, we stay confident in terms of double -digit growth in the medium term. On Wholesale Transaction Banking, it remains an area of competitive advantage .  We will continue to grow there, but it’s going to be hard to predict quarter to quarter, especially in the current environment .

I just want to be clear that the scenario does not include the secondary impact of any change in policy rates in terms of the revenue -related scenario .  Secondly, none of these two scenarios have what you call an extreme downside to scenario , with a double -digit contraction of GDP like we saw in the Covid period , just to give you some guardrails. So in terms of Hong Kong CRE, this was a relatively quiet quarter .  We did have one specific name, which , in the performing book, there was a credit downgrade .

HSBC,Barclays,2025,Q1,analyst,"Hey, George s.  Hey, Pam .  Thanks very much for the various updates and sensitivities that you’ve given us .  I had two questions just around customer behavio ur.  So I just wondered if you’d observed any material shift in the way that your customers are transacting with you .  Have you seen any forward indicators around sentiment, any signs of de -risking or de -leveraging, any shift in particularly your corporate customers that might be on the receiving end of trade tariffs ?  Any insight s there would be really helpful. And then the second is, definitely get the message around continuing to execute on the existing strategy .  I guess just two related points to that , one around capital returns .  It’s great that you’ve announced a $3 billion buyback .  You’re talking about a more subdued outl ook for lending by extension RWAs , so presumably you might be quite capital generative this year .  So it seems like you’re committed to distributions despite the uncertainty .  It’s an uncertain backdrop, but the pace of distributions that you’re executing on , it feels like you’re committed to that .  Is that the right rea d?  Should we be confident around things like the buyback sustainability from here ?

HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"V ery good .  Thank you very much, Aman .  I’m going to take your first question about customer behavio ur, and I’ll ask Pam to address both our capital return strategy, as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavio ur, I think nothing that would really surprise you .  Corporate customers , essentially , are in a wait -and-see mode , so some of the capex or large investments are on hold .  Certainly, some of the shipments from China, specifically to the US, have slowed down, but we’ve seen no panic .  So there’s been no significant drawdowns .  Deposit behavio ur has remained normal , so nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see. In terms of personal banking and Wealth customers ’ activity, this has been quite strong . Remember, we have a diversified product offering .  So we’ve seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings, be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets, such as mutual funds or structured products .  And when customers want to take a risk-off approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base , so we capture the customer assets  either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first three months of the year, it remained positive, strong , so we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business .  Remember also, we’re investing in this business, so we’re capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we’re also capturing market share in the way we’re investing in this business .  Pam?",positive,0.9995393753,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"Thanks, Aman .  So just one point to add on the Wealth customer behavio urs. Our strength really lies in our very broad product proposition .  So as we see the mix shift between US equities or Asian equities, or , indeed , into short -term fixed income products, we are there to support our customers, as well as in terms of insurance on more protection and savings -related products .  So that gives us confidence that this double -digit growth continues, and we have seen the same trend even through April, and the same trend also, no panic, no drawdowns, and deposit behavio ur normal through April .  So that’s just to set that. So coming down to distribution , just as a starting point, we have our policy on ordinary dividends .  I’m assuming your question is much more on share buybacks, but let me see overall on the process we follow .  Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of our CET1, and you know our CET1 operating range is between 14 % to 14.5% .  We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do .  And what’s very important is , routinely, we look at a range of scenario s in terms of the macroeconomic environment, and then , based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital .  We have not changed our view on capital redeployment, but , as I’ve said, we look at opportunities, we look at the generative capability, quarter on quarter, and that’s how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks.",positive,0.9987946749,Capital adequacy
HSBC,UBS,2025,Q1,analyst,"Good m orning . So two questions, please .

What is it that you’d say in terms of opex funding costs and Page 7 of 13 what restructuring charges may go with that ?  So when you made that motivation, what was the maths behind it? And then , secondly, very strong performance in costs in Q1, but guidance held constant for the year ahead .  I guess that implies potentially some slippage in efficiency ratios in the quarters to come, notwithstanding the cost -saving actions that are underway .

HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"T hank you, Kian .  So firstly, just to reiterate, the $42 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full -year 2025 .  Now, we’ve looked at a range of reasonable upside /downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios , despite the stress work that we have done .  Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us on a good trajectory, given that range of scenarios we’ve looked at  – all plausible upsides and downsides. Now, as always, there are four key drivers .  The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves .  The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates .  We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment, so there’ll be an upside to that .  The other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we’ve said before, and loans stay muted .  Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong  Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had contracted. Now, the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year, at 39%, and that is continuing even through April .  So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behavio urs of our customers, both from a corporate side as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable. So on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is – and it’s all in terms of seeing the various scenarios , in terms of delivering the mid -teens RoTE.  Firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking NII, which is Wholesale Transaction Banking, and it has many more products beyond trade finance.  It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra -regional corridors.  When we have looked at the downside scenario, we’ve looked at higher tariffs, we have l ooked at impact on GDP, we have looked more broadly at policy rates, inflation – the big picture – but again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside two scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double -digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the Covid period. So if we look at all that, we come to a low single -digit percentage impact on revenues, and within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid - teens RoTE for the next three years.  Now, the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter -on-quarter. Page 9 of 13 On costs, our cost trajectory is on track, and given this, there’s no shift on that, and we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming ver y quickly in those areas, even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that’s primarily on the wealth side.",positive,0.9995848536,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"Okay, thank you, Amit.  Amit, I’m going to ask Pam to comment on your second question, but on your first question, we’re not going to give more details than what we’ve shared, but I think your analogy to say that it’s downside one like sc enario in the sense that it is adverse but plausible is correct.  And within that scenario, without additional cost actions than the one that we have set out to do and are on -track for doing, and obviously committed to do, we are confident we can achieve o ur targets, in particular our targets of mid - teen returns for ’25, ’26 and ’27.  Pam.",positive,0.9984294772,Stress testing
HSBC,KBW,2025,Q1,analyst,"Good morning, everybody.  Thanks very much for taking the questions.  I just had a couple.  The first one – I noticed that your cost guidance is based on an average Page 11 of 13 exchange rate in Q1, but the US dollar is off 6% since then, so I assume that if we were to actually do that at today’s exchange rate, your cost number would be somewhat higher than that.  I’m just trying to check – is your revenue guidance also based on t hose exchange rates? Is it effectively like we should gear up both revenue and costs for the weakened dollar in terms of our expectations?  That’s the first point. I guess partly related to that, are we actually in the plausible downside scenario now?  Trade flows from China to the US are down 45% booking, something like that.  That feels to me like a pretty downside scenario.  Should we assume that as we go through Q2 and Q3, we are actually in that scenario now?  Is that effectively where we are, assuming nothing changes? And I guess nobody has any idea what will happen in terms of the changes, but assuming we stay where we are today. And then my second question was just about Bocom .  I can’t really understand the accounting, because you’re still running with a valuation that’s $10 billion above the market value, but you didn’t subscribe for new shares with the capital raise , which I assume you would have done if you had thought it really was worth that much more.  Should we be expecting you to correct that down to what would be a market price rather than just the $1.6bn?  Should we be revisiting how you do the – I think you call it valu e in use, something like that.  Thanks very much.",negative,0.9812038541,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"Okay, thank you very much, Ed.  Let me take your plausible downside scenario, and I’ll ask Pam to address the cost question as well as the Bocom  accounting question.  So the adverse plausible downside scenario is a scenario that is further adverse from where we are today, with significantly higher global tariffs on major trading blocks on an aggregate basis, and we’ve looked at their impact across  obviously our trade business but more importantly across over all our volumes and the economi c outlook of our businesses on the whole.  We do recognise that there is uncertainty and it’s very difficult to understand how much downside or upside there is in the future outlook for this, but we believe this plausible downside scenario is not the expec ted scenario, as in it is a lower probability downside than the expected scenario.  Pam ?",positive,0.9414616823,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"So Ed, the share issuance was subscribed by government or government -related entities in China.  We were happy with our holding as it is, and therefore we’re happy with the outcome.  With regards to the actual accounting value, I would pr obably point you to the investor relations team which can take you through some of the specificities of the equity accounting principles which are quite unique in the way we treat the associate accounting  of Bocom .  I just want to re -emphasise we’re happy with our holding in Bocom . We’re happy with our strategic relationship with Bocom  and the fact that they give us exposure to the domestic economy in China, be it retail, SME, outlook, which is not something our organic business is involved in, and very importantly, what Pam said – the valuation in our NAV is Page 12 of 13 deducted from CET1, which means these impairments have a very minimal second order impact on our CET1 ratio, and therefore also do not impact our distribution capability.",positive,0.9981733561,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q1,banker,"Yeah, thanks, Katherine.  So absolutely, being a stress downside scenario, plausible but severe, we typically take the downside.  We don’t take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures.  It’s purely tariffs and retaliator y tariffs in a plausible range.  So all said and done, just want to reaffirm it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving. On loan growth, the situation is, in some ways, similar to where were at the end of Q4, because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision -making, so we are not seeing any of those capex decisions being brought forward.  They were delayed.  They will continue to be delayed. Hopefully at some stage, some certainty remains there will be loan growth.  We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns, just lik e we observed in Q2 of 2020.  At this point of time, there is no increa se in drawdowns.  So overall from a loan growth perspective, I will say still muted in terms of what we are seeing.  The only thing I would say is that if there is continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit of pick -up from an OpEx perspe ctive on working capital, because then you have to pay important duties up front and there’s some delays and some of the money’s coming and so on, so that will have an impact.  But from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidanc e of $42 billion is really deposits, for which we have a very strong franchise.  We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expected that to grow.  Of course, there’ll be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter -on-quarter, bu t overall that trend has continued.",positive,0.5523542166,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"The $42 billion guidance includes market expectations of HIBOR implied above 2% in third quarter. So we’ve already said that HIBOR at a 1% impacts us by $100 million per month, so if you look overall, our HIBOR expectations as well as the impact of the $100 million – all these are included when you look at our overall confidence in the BNII guidance for the year. The BNII guidance is not just based on the forward curves. As we know, in Q2, very low HIBOR impacted us for around six to seven weeks. We have given more detail of it in the appendix, but a couple of things have moved around. The time deposits are now four points lower, and you look at those factors, and as we look for the rest of the year, there will be some upside and downside in terms of the timing of when the HIBOR shifts happen, as well as the dollar depreciation, how long it continues. In Q2, it was a tailwind for us. In terms of ECLs, so from an ECL perspective, we only give you the 2025 number. It’s fair to say that we have always in the last few years stayed between the 30 to 40 basis points, sometimes a bit to the upper end, so we’re not giving any guidance beyond 2025 at this stage.",negative,0.9693505168,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"On tariffs, first, tariffs have never been a new feature of global trade. They have always been there, although we have seen recently a more significant shift in the US tariff policy. That’s created more uncertainty but, at the same time now, we’re encouraged to see that more agreements are being concluded, and this is giving us ideally more certainty as we look into the future. There are important things to call out. One, as you did see from our Q2 results, our trade Fee and other income has grown by 4%, and the reasons are multiple. First, we are positioned across some of the fastest growing trade corridors on the planet, specifically the ones in Asia or between Asia and the Middle East and various parts of the world where trade continues to grow significantly higher trends than some of the more traditional trade corridors and we have a leadership position across these intra-Asia, Asia-Middle East corridors. Second is we kept investing at pace in our services trade sector and now we have capabilities there and we’re able to capture much faster growth in the services trade sector than what has been the growth exhibited in the goods trade sector and that’s another area of strength for HBSC. Third, even in trade so far that the US is involved in, imports into the US, some of the unique propositions we’ve put forward such as TradePay have given unique support to US importers in helping them manage their working capital facilities and helping them meet the duties they are due to pay for tariffs in a way that allowed us to continue growing our business and gaining share. You put all of this together – you put the expertise we have with more than 5,000 trade specialists across more than 50 markets where we operate – and you can see the resilience of our business to uncertainty. Actually, it is a period where we can differentiate, continue gaining market share, deepening customer relationships, acquiring more customers and this is what we envisage for the expertise we have and the strength we have in our trade business. With regards to scenarios, I would like Pam to take you through it, but remember some of these scenarios are including extreme market movements such as interest rates at 1% which have material impact beyond the pure trade impact on our business.",positive,0.9996248484,Capital adequacy

HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"With Hong Kong CRE, the first thing, as you may expect, is we know this market very well. We’ve been in Hong Kong for 160 years, involved in the sector, and we’re comfortable with the position in this market. That’s very important to call out. Specifically, as regards residential development, this has stabilised. This has stabilised and we’re encouraged by that. It’s stabilised mostly because of policy support measures that have been taken, as well as because of a robust rental market more recently but, when we look wider in the CRE space, specifically around the office CRE space in Hong Kong, we’re still struggling because of some oversupply in this space. We are encouraged by some additional government action taken to restrict land sales and office CRE and this should work its way into the medium term by restricting supply and supporting the recovery of pricing in this space, but there will be some short-term pressure. Of the exposure we have on Hong Kong CRE, we basically called out less than 5% of it – around $1.5 billion of that exposure – where we continue to look with focus and attention. That $1.5 billion is to the weak borrowers that are either sub-standard or credit impaired, where the long- term value of the collateral is above 70%. Against this $1.5 billion, we have a $0.5 billion ECL. It gives you a quantum of what a worst case scenario in this space can be and that is the segment we’re looking at. Across the wider spectrum on Hong Kong CRE, what I can say is our mission is obviously to continue to support our customers as they work through some of the short-term challenges they’re going through but, in the medium to long term, we remain confident in the supply/demand dynamic in Hong Kong and the appeal of Hong Kong real estate at large and, therefore, remain constructive and optimistic about the medium to long term. The comment I want to make on BoCom is it’s purely coincidental. There is no correlation whatsoever between an accounting process related to the VIU process versus any other information, but remember the BoCom impairments have no CET 1 impact. They have no CET 1 ratio impact. They have, therefore, also no distribution impact in terms of dividend or share buyback, so I really encourage you to look at it as a pure accounting but no actual economic impact to the bank.",positive,0.9988849759,Credit risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"On Hong Kong CRE, our book is down $1 billion to $32 billion and it’s mainly because of repayments done at the unsecured end of the book, where the exposure is mainly to very strong, diverse conglomerates, which are nearly 95% rated Strong or Good and have had very little impairment. That’s 42% of our limits. The increase that we have seen in the impaired book, you’re right. $600 million is largely to the secured side of the portfolio and the ECL stage 2 allowance increase is entirely due to models. Out of that, the charge we’ve taken of $400 million in the quarter, $100 million is due to the modelling charges. As Georges has said, the area we are most focused on is the sub-standard and the credit impaired side of the book, where the exposure if $1.4 billion. There is already an existing ECL charge of $500 million, so you can see further down what it means from an outlook perspective. Overall, when we have refreshed our ECL guidance, we obviously stress it with upside, downside and some fairly stringent requirements and we continuously monitor our book and we think that overall guidance that we have given in terms of around 40 basis points captures the entirety of the risk in the Hong Kong CRE book as we look at it now. On BoCom – and, as Georges said, of course we do not link impairment timing to anything else. It’s a routine quarterly accounting process. Again, we use our models. It’s a value-in-use model. It is very sensitive to input factors, so even a small shift in basis points can make it move up or down and, when we make an impairment, it’s because the fair value from the model is below the carrying value. We have already given you details on the model’s sensitivity to the various inputs in our annual report and nothing has changed in that process.",negative,0.9955461025,Credit risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"First, cost discipline is ingrained in the firm quarter after quarter, year after year. It’s a commitment we have to this discipline. It’s our confidence in our ability to meet the commitments we have and it’s the fact that we are on track on all the cost items, be it our underlying cost or the cost saves. That one doesn’t change. In terms of the cost takeout, the cost takeout that’s taking place now that we’re calling out is a cost takeout related to organisation simplification. Remember it is an intention to simplify the organisation, make us simple and agile, but there’s obviously an ancillary benefit, which is a cost reduction from de-duplication of roles with limited impact on our revenue generation capabilities. That one is moving at pace, and we just revised upwards the saves we can achieve this year towards the target of $1.5 billion which we will take to the bottom line and we expect to achieve by the full-year 2026. There’s another cost takeout, which is exiting of non-strategic activities. We announced seven exits since the Q1 results. These in total will add up to about $1.5 billion of cost takeout. About a third has already been announced. A third is being worked on and we intend, once these cost saves are achieved, to reinvest this into our core revenue growth areas, strategic areas where we have competitive advantage and can generate accretive returns, but these are not the only levers we have on costs. We continue working on our operating leveraging cost. As you know, efficiency and productivity drives including through GenAI, automation and other modernisation of our capabilities will continue as a matter of regular course of business and these improvements will continue helping us manage our costs. I’m not going to comment on 2026 – we have not guided to it – just given the amount of saves we expect to achieve from the simplification in 2026. On banking NII, the one comment I’d like to make is that we continue growing our deposit base and continue being extremely liquid to support growth in loan as and when our customers start investing again. We called out $83 billion growth in our deposits over the last 12 months. That’s a 5% growth in our deposit base and our deposits drive the lion’s share of our banking NII and that’s a very important lever in the growth potential we can achieve in banking NII in terms of volume growth.",positive,0.9995877147,Conduct risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"Cost discipline will very much continue, not just into 2026, but further on as well and we also said earlier we will continue to invest in ways of increasing our productivity and that will be something which will be a priority for us. That’s something we can control and we have shown you a good track record in the first few quarters. We continue to focus on that. Coming down to banking NII - you’re right - around $42 billion. You may deem it to be conservative, if you just do the simple arithmetic, in terms of what the run rate takes us to and this quarter we had obviously the headwind from HIBOR, but it was offset to some extent by a weaker US dollar. The timing of how long the US dollar depreciation continues and on HIBOR also is important. We are assuming that there will be a sharp normalisation of HIBOR within this quarter to around the 2% mark. Obviously, any delay, even this delay of the month of July costs $100 million at a 1% HIBOR. What we will have as a benefit still coming in the rest of the year is the structural hedge, which is a tailwind. We’ve got a reinvestment of $55 billion in the second half at 2.8%. We have to reinvest and there’s an improvement of 2% on that in terms of the reinvestment rates as they stand, so that obviously is a tailwind. The balance sheet growth has been a real positive and it’s mainly driven by deposits. Our Hong Kong time deposit migration in a lower interest rate was four points into Q2, but obviously this can move up or down. In terms of levers to offset the HIBOR pressures, the Hong Kong time deposits were repriced. We also saw some balance sheet growth happening, because part of the weakness of the HIBOR was because of the strong Southbound connecting flows into Hong Kong and that immediately gave us the benefit to our deposit line. We have been also active in Markets Treasury. The benefit of that goes into Fee and other income. All in all, there are a number of areas in which we can pull levers to be very confident on our around $42 billion guidance for banking NII but, as always, we will be conservative, realistic, and if we out-perform, we out- perform.",positive,0.9993484616,Market risk
HSBC,CICC,2025,Q2,analyst,"I have two questions. The first is about the non-interest income. I’ve seen that HSBC delivered quite strong non-interest income in both quarter one and quarter two, primarily driven by the wealth management FX and the capital markets-related business. I wonder how you see the sustainability of this momentum going forward. The second question is about the stablecoin, because there are several countries and areas that have introduced stablecoin-related regulations. How does HSBC view the cryptocurrency area? Do you have some reservations in this area, or will you maintain a cautious approach in this area?",positive,0.9994059801,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"On digitised means of payment, we have launched tokenised deposit services for our wholesale customers. It’s live in Hong Kong and Singapore. It will be live in September in the UK and in the Eurozone and then early in 2026, it’ll be live in a number of other countries, including the US, the UAE and others. This will allow our wholesale customers – and is already allowing our wholesale customers – to do cross-border transactions with their suppliers or the other counterparties on a real-time basis and on an ‘always on’, as in 24/7, basis. That service is live and is developing and we continue investing in it. It’s programmable and it basically leverages the blockchain technology. We’re very pleased with this development. Beyond what we already offer in terms of tokenised deposits, we are watching very closely the regulatory developments around stablecoin. We are very encouraged about Hong Kong, indeed, issuing regulation there. Obviously, the US, with the GENIUS bill, is publishing regulation there. What we will monitor, one, is that the regulation addresses all our regulatory- related concerns, such as financial crime, prudential and other risks. We will also monitor the issuers of stablecoin and their compliance with these regulations and then, subject to those, we will evaluate all potential banking services we can do with them or customers involved with these issuers. We expect to move at pace. With regards to other crypto, at this stage, we have no appetite to be involved in other kind of algorithmic or other non-pegged cryptocurrencies. As an asset class, we still do not have risk appetite to be involved in that space. With regards our non-NII, there are a few comments I want to make and I’ll hand over to Pam. It’s a very important area for us. It’s a very important investment area for us. Let me talk about first transaction banking. We have a leadership position. We’re a top two player in global transaction banking. In payments and FX and trade – we’re the trade bank – for seven or eight consecutive years, the largest trade bank. It’s an area of unique strength, unique expertise. It’s an area of continued investment, both in digital capabilities and customer servicing, and we continue to see this area as resiliently growing, as demonstrated by 5% growth in Q2, of which 4% growth was within trade itself. That resilient underlying growth is due to the fact that we continue deepening customer relationships, gaining market share and acquiring new customers through all our expertise and our investment. The second one I want to talk to is wealth – six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Our target there is to grow in the medium term at double-digit rates, but that could be volatile a quarter to quarter, based on market conditions. This is also an area of active investment with intent. Our footprint, our brand, our heritage in Asia and the Middle East in particular give us unique strength to be able to accelerate this growth and continue gaining market share, benefitting from the underlying growth in the market. We’ve demonstrated a number of initiatives that we’ve already rolled out, be it in Wealth Centres, relationship managers or technology capabilities, digital capabilities we’ve been rolling out to our customers. Last, but not least, Capital Markets and Advisory, our debt and equity trading – all of whom have benefited also from our focused investment and our capabilities to be more meaningful and relevant for our customers and deliver growth as we did also in Q2.",positive,0.9867067933,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"We have been focusing on growing our Fee and other income. As Georges has said, it’s been a focus area and we’ve seen strong performance, albeit, in the last two quarters, there has been the tailwind of market conditions and it’s hard to predict when these transactional tailwinds will fade away. Nevertheless, if you look at the various parts that build up to this Fee and other income, FX was up 7% - a very strong position in FX. There’s a baseline that will always be a growth engine. Investment Distribution was up 24%. Private Banking was up 12%, and there are also other annuity revenues, which are like our net new invested assets, which are up $75 billion over the last four quarters, so not really helped just by tailwinds, and also, the insurance CSM balance is at record levels, and that’ll just drip into the P&L over time, so that’s also like an annuity. Now, there’s just one or two items which I would call one-offs or specifically volatile beyond the transactional tailwinds. One is the Argentina hyperinflation, which was the $200 million impact in Q2 of 2024. Obviously, it was not a repeat in Q2 of 2025, but with Argentina gone, that is not going to be again coming into the comparison. And the other was the $100 million related to Markets Treasury activity, and that will be volatile. It will change from quarter to quarter.

HSBC,Jefferies,2025,Q2,analyst,"Just a simple follow-up on the Hong Kong CRE, which I think you’ve done a pretty good job of addressing. I guess what drove the timing of this charge, because some of the dynamics that you point out in the interim report you could have easily argued were there in Q4, so I guess what drove the timing of today versus Q4? And then, is there any way to gauge what you think the appropriate coverage level is because, clearly, I think you also had about 20 bps of credit risk migration in last year’s CET1 from this. I’m just trying to walk through the moving parts to dimension any further charges. Thanks.",neutral,0.9068314433,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"So firstly, part of the charge, you said, is a model change, and the model changes happen periodically, and that’s only $100 million. The key thing that we look at every quarter and we looked at the last year-end as well, is valuations. Now, valuations is an ongoing process. You see the valuations in terms of orderly valuations, but the valuations also get impacted even on the performing book when you see some distressed valuations. And already, we had started considering distressed valuations as part of our ECL charge for the year-end by giving some probability for those distressed valuations, and this lag on a performing book, because the book is still performing on the valuations as it comes as part of our credit processes – we do a read-across to the book. Now, generally, the LTVs have remained strong, so just to say the LTVs which have gone higher than 70% is still a very small portion of the book, but while we are focused on this, we are, as in every quarter, looking at the rest of the book. The real challenge continues with the over-supply in the office space. Now, it’s not across everywhere the same. It depends upon the location of the office space; it depends upon the quality of the building. Has it been new, refurbed, or otherwise? So that’s the piece that we also then bear in mind when we look at the valuation shift, to say, ‘Is there any greater calibration or divergence from the kind of property, the use of property?’ And the overall liquidity in the market, in terms of actual transactions, has been relatively low.",positive,0.9967288971,Liquidity
HSBC,Goldman Sachs,2025,Q2,analyst,"I have two, please. The first is on FX. It’s good to see strong growth all across non-banking NII, but on FX, you called out good growth, but I wonder, we’ve seen some unusual currency volatility in the quarter; did that not lead us to generate above normal FX growth, and at 7%, would you call it above normal? So what were clients’ feedback? Were they churning portfolios more, hedging, etc, during the quarter, on FX? Because I see, Q on Q, also, it’s down. And then, on loan growth, we see some pick-up in the UK book, but then, in Hong Kong, China region, with the lower interest rates, are we seeing client demand come back in for loan growth, and how do we see the outlook there? Thank you.",positive,0.9969266057,Market risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"Yes, FX has benefited from increased customer activity due to higher volatility. This is something that is difficult to forecast, but what is important to note is that it remains one of our core capabilities in transaction banking, and we remain one of the top players, I would say top two global players, in this space, and therefore, we do have a leadership market share in this space and capture client activity. It’s difficult to forecast what kind of volatility we may see going forward in Foreign Exchange, but we will continue being one of the main counterparties to support our customers’ hedging activities. On loan growth, I was actually particularly encouraged with the UK Commercial banking corporate loan growth. It’s early to call it a trend, $3.5 billion growth, but it is definitely a green shoot in this space where it has been subdued for many quarters now. So we have seen the UK credit book remain very resilient through the last few years, but we haven’t seen it grow, and hopefully, with more clarity about the UK and the tariffs related to the UK, we can see more investments taking through. The additional comment I would like to make about the UK specifically and then hand over to Pam is that we’re very encouraged by the UK having also moved at pace in their trade negotiations with trade agreements now concluded with the US, with the EU, since Brexit, and then more recently with India, which is a historic trade deal where we have a very vibrant business corridor going on between the UK and India. And we’re frankly very, very excited about supporting our customers along this corridor to realise the benefits in their businesses.",positive,0.9996452332,Credit risk
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"So, just to make a comment on FX, of course there’s a transactional nature to FX, but we are very engaged with our customers, and we have been capturing flows well, and at the back of that, we are accelerating our investment in this business to grow medium term so that we can be best positioned to support our customers. From a loan growth perspective, so in Q1, we saw growth in Asia, ex Hong Kong, China. And that’s been stable, but it’s moving along, and obviously, Q2, given some of the tariffs news, people were slower in terms of making their decisions. In the UK, our growth was good, but also, our focus was very much across sectors which were growing, so whether it’s in the infrastructure space and so on. So we were very focused, and that held up well. We are doing the same engagement level on our customers across the globe, and from a growth perspective, at the back of the interest rates coming down, the other factor which is very important, and we’ve called it out before, is macro uncertainty. So, when this macro uncertainty continues, the capex decisions are delayed. However, from a working capital, we see some early engagement where people are looking at how they shift and change some of their business models, and so on. What I do want to say is that, overall, where we have good benefits still coming through from our NII line is our deposit base, which is, as I’ve called out, up $83 billion year on year, so that stays a very strong component, as part of our NII business. And I would say, from an FX perspective, the other thing to bear in mind is we’re seeing strong flows into Hong Kong through the depressed HIBOR, so that is another factor to balance overall in our outlook.",positive,0.9995808005,Capital adequacy
HSBC,JP Morgan,2025,Q2,analyst,"I have three questions. The first is that I would want to ask about what are the outstanding parts of the threshold deduction related to the BoCom, if there is further impairment on BoCom? If there’s further impairment on BoCom, what would the amount be in order for that future impairment to have an impact on your CET1 ratios and share buyback and EPS, and so forth? Number two is related to the $0.6 billion of restructuring-related costs. What portion of it is in the material notable items, i.e. what I mean is what portion of the $0.6 billion has no impact on DPS, and what portion of it may have an impact on DPS? And then, the last question is for Georges - on tokenised deposits. So may I know, for this tokenised deposit, is it only for HSBC clients or also available for HSBC’s clients’ clients? Is that on public chains, i.e. can clients basically use this tokenised deposit to transact crypto assets? So say, for example, if they want to trade Bitcoin or other crypto assets, can they use this tokenised deposit to facilitate that? Thank you.",neutral,0.9987933636,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"Let me then answer your third question; I’ll ask Pam to address the first two. So, today, this is available to HSBC’s clients and any whitelisted clients’ clients, or clients’ counterparties, but ultimately, they need to go through the HSBC standards for know your client, financial crime checks, among other kinds of checks. So the capabilities will be extended, but will be expanded in a way where we remain very comfortable with the KYC considerations to be able to onboard them as clients or future clients. We are looking, obviously, at stablecoin developments. We believe it is still early to understand how some of these stablecoin issuers are able to KYC the wider client base. Some of them are, but obviously, the regulations are going to dictate, for those who will be effectively whitelisted, what these requirements are, and we will evaluate accordingly over the next few weeks and months as this develops. Your first question is related to BoCom, and your second question is related to the restructuring- related costs and whether they will be treated as notable or materially notable. Pam will address both, but let me say one thing about BoCom is we have ample room for any potential future impairments, whether they happen or not, before this even comes near affecting CET1 or CET1 ratio or our distribution capabilities.",positive,0.8591110706,Capital adequacy
HSBC,HSBC,2025,Q2,banker,"We have $14 billion of threshold deductions - that’s slide 33 of the deck. And on slide 28, we give you more details on BoCom, including the market value in the footnote, which is at $13 billion. So, as Georges says, even if there was an impairment to market value, it will have no material impact on CET1. And in terms of restructuring costs, they are a notable item, but they’re not a material notable item for the dividend.",neutral,0.9934251308,Capital adequacy
