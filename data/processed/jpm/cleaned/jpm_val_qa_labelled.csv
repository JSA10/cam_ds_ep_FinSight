0,2023,Q4,1.0,1.0,Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_1.0
1,2023,Q4,4.0,1.0,"Okay. And then, just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful. Thanks. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.","Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_4.0
2,2023,Q4,5.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that? Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_5.0
3,2023,Q4,6.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_6.0
4,2023,Q4,6.0,2.0,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?","So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry about the tail scenarios – is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q4_6.0
5,2023,Q4,9.0,1.0,"Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024? Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","A little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So, the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_9.0
6,2023,Q4,10.0,1.0,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to AI and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks.","Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so, that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short- term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_10.0
7,2023,Q4,10.0,2.0,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much is that due to AI and what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pick-up? Thanks.","Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_10.0
8,2023,Q4,14.0,1.0,"Okay, very good. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's – the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrinkage in system- wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q4_14.0
9,2023,Q4,17.0,1.0,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head-to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q4_17.0
10,2023,Q4,18.0,1.0,"Anything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has? Okay, cool. Thank you for that. Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.","It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_18.0
11,2023,Q4,20.0,2.0,"Just to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have NII ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well or up?","Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then this is like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-4q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q4_20.0
12,2024,Q4,2.0,1.0,"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.","Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms- up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q4_2.0
13,2024,Q4,2.0,2.0,"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.","Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment. John McDonald Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Very helpful.

14,2024,Q4,4.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.","Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of Hey, Jim.

Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that.

17,2024,Q4,6.0,1.0,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?","Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10% numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2024_Q4_6.0
18,2024,Q4,8.0,1.0,"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?","Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q4_8.0

But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking? Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning.","Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.

Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy And I guess – thanks for that. Gerard Cassidy","Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.

You could see some growth and you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?","That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-4q24-earnings-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2024_Q4_13.0

Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is.

24,2023,Q1,2.0,1.0,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_2.0
25,2023,Q1,3.0,1.0,"Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.","Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-1q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q1_3.0

Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.","Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale.

I'm wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.,"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation.

28,2023,Q1,14.0,1.0,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non-banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the non-banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the non-banks. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Yeah, so I'd like to answer that. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's very, very secure.

I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?","Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need.

It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well.

So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_3.0

We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now.

Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_5.0

Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.","I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list.

38,2023,Q2,10.0,1.0,"That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too? Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point.

39,2023,Q2,12.0,1.0,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as well? Thank you. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_12.0
40,2023,Q2,14.0,2.0,"Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you. Okay. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix. There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners.

42,2023,Q2,15.0,2.0,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?","Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_15.0
43,2023,Q2,16.0,2.0,"Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not? Wait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years, going back to it. And then last quick follow-up...","Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them don't.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_16.0

Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.","Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period.

46,2023,Q2,22.0,1.0,"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside – or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system? Appreciate that, Jeremy. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_22.0

I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is. So then…","Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q23-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2023_Q2_23.0

What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher-for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?","Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And, of course, that hasn't happened yet this year, so that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration. But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher-for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_1.0

I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q3_2.0
51,2023,Q3,4.0,1.0,"Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color in the slides, so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR. Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.","Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes. Some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks, but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non-optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a bit of a long answer but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_4.0
52,2023,Q3,6.0,1.0,"That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philosophical side I think Jamie was speaking last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized? Got it. Thank you. BPI did, yeah. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a thousand-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed, in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q3_6.0

And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?","Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_8.0

And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted.

55,2023,Q3,11.0,1.0,"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest- bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?","Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_11.0

Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Evasive,2023_Q3_12.0
58,2023,Q3,12.0,8.0,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re-asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for- longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?","And I would just add quantitative tightening in there.

You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now, or is this just simply a moon shot?","Oh, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data, looking at everything on the internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots so they know to widen the client's coin or something like that.

And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets business specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business? Right. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product. For some products it's worse than for others, but generally it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish. We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that, but the other thing about market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_19.0

63,2023,Q3,20.0,1.0,"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?","Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/.ipynb_checkpoints/jpm-3q23-earnings-call-transcript-checkpoint.pdf,Direct,2023_Q3_20.0
64,2024,Q1,3.0,1.0,"Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside. Right. Great. Thanks for the color.","Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long- term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_3.0
65,2024,Q1,5.0,1.0,"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Thank you.","That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex.

66,2024,Q1,9.0,1.0,"Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that – it seems like the market down pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would...","Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here.

So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So, dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so, we cautioned a little bit there about pull-forward. Which is even more acute I think on the DCM side, given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year, has gotten done in the first quarter.

71,2024,Q1,14.0,1.0,"Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So, is there just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if.","Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, was the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that. So, I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So, you could see some mean reversion there.

72,2024,Q1,16.0,1.0,"Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.","Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like – into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago, is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it and we will. So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviously, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position which is, in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_16.0
73,2024,Q1,18.0,1.0,"Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?","Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think, in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you're seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived over the last few weeks, and it was little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q1_18.0
74,2024,Q1,19.0,1.0,"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there, both as a competitor, but also as a client of JPMorgan? How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supporting their business?","Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level. But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is, stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo. So, you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future here.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_19.0

Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So, do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's my question. Alright. Thank you.","Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-1q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q1_21.0

77,2024,Q2,2.0,1.0,"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization? Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_2.0
78,2024,Q2,5.0,1.0,"Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year, and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.","Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance.

On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down-rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so, we'll just have to see how that plays out.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q2_5.0
80,2024,Q2,6.0,1.0,"Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks.","Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still – it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend.

81,2024,Q2,9.0,1.0,"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?","Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_9.0
82,2024,Q2,10.0,1.0,"Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.","Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But that feels a bit speculative to me at this point. Matt O'Connor Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Got it. Okay.

83,2024,Q2,12.0,1.0,"Your 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?","I mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_12.0
84,2024,Q2,14.0,1.0,"So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here. All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.","Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so, we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about – Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9 billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-2q24-earnings-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q2_14.0

86,2024,Q2,19.0,1.0,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over- year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks. Right. Okay. Great.","Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient.

88,2024,Q3,2.0,1.0,"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.","Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q3_2.0

90,2024,Q3,4.0,1.0,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said. Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?","Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Evasive,2024_Q3_4.0

Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model.

Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end. So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_4.0
93,2024,Q3,5.0,1.0,"And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?","Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in life you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of shareholders, and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point.

95,2024,Q3,6.0,1.0,"Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks. All right. Thanks for all that. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're growing and partnering and things like that. And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the venue. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or $30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more than $1 billion, we'll do it sole-handed or we'll do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to get permission from everybody, because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and making sure we're offering them the best thing. And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific thing and not the solution that this is the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that, so I hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.",Jamie Dimon,Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_6.0

And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean.

101,2024,Q3,24.0,1.0,"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise. Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure. But you're not dramatically above those levels. Yes. Got it. Thanks a lot. That's all I got. Jeremy Barnum Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks, Saul.","Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40",Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,banker,data/raw/jpm/jpm-3q24-earnings-conference-call-transcript.pdf,Direct,2024_Q3_24.0
